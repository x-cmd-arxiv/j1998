In SSH's grey radiative transfer procedure (unoptimized) the\nmean opacity is a pure absorption opacity and it is a constant aside from a\nusually weak composition dependence. In this paper, we present a variation on\nthe SSH procedure which uses multiple mean opacities which have both absorption\nand scattering components. There is a mean opacity for each order of Compton\nscattering. A local-state (LS) approximation permits an analytic solution for\nthe gamma-ray transfer of scattered gamma-ray fields. The LS approximation is\nadmittedly crude, but the scattered fields are always of lesser importance to\nthe energy deposition. We call our procedure the LS grey radiative transfer\nprocedure or LS procedure for short. For a standard Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)\nmodel the uncertainty in gamma-ray energy deposition is estimated to be of\norder 10 % or less. The LS procedure code used for this paper can be obtained\nby request from the author.\n  For completeness and easy reference, we include in this paper a review of the\ngamma-ray opacities important in supernovae, a discussion of the appropriate\nmean opacity prescription, and a discussion of the errors arising from\nneglecting time-dependent and non-static radiative transfer effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 1998 00:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Cosmic Ray particles have been observed up to 3 10^20 eV, with many\narguments suggesting, that up to about 3 10^18 eV they are of Galactic origin.\nCosmic ray particles get injected by supernova explosions. Their injected\nspectrum is steepened by diffusive losses from the Galaxy to yield the observed\nspectrum.

The energy range covered (800 < E(gamma) <\n1120 MeV) lies mostly below the free rho^0 production threshold, a region which\nis believed sensitive to modifications of light vector-meson properties at\nnuclear-matter densities. The rho^0 masses extracted from the MC fitting of the\ndata, m*(rho^0) = 642 +/- 40, 669 +/- 32, and 682 +/- 56 MeV/c^2 for E(gamma)\nin the 800-880, 880-960, and 960-1040 MeV regions respectively, are\nindependently corroborated by a measured, assumption-free, kinematical\nobservable.
