We represented the spectra by 15 Principal Components,\nwhich form the input for the ANN. The latter was trained with morphological\ntypes from Dressler, and its success rate was estimated from an independent\ntesting set of galaxies. The success-rate for an early- (E+S0) vs. late-type\n(Sp+Irr) classification is close to 75 %; somewhat higher for the early-type\ngalaxies, and somewhat lower for the late-type galaxies. Using the results of\nthe PCA/ANN analysis ('spectral' galaxy types for 3798 galaxies, 57 % of which\nare of early type and 43 % of late type) we constructed a composite cluster of\n2594 galaxies. The late-type galaxies appear to have a larger line-of-sight\nvelocity dispersion and are less centrally concentrated than the early-type\ngalaxies. The late-type galaxies with emission lines (OII, H-beta, OIII) in\ntheir spectra are mostly responsible for this difference. The properties of the\nlate-type galaxies without emission lines are more like those of the early-type\ngalaxies than like those of the late-type galaxies with emission lines. The\ninterpretation of the large velocity dispersion and the extended distribution,\nin terms of fairly radial (possibly 'first-approach') orbits is probably linked\nprimarily to the presence of emission-line gas and much less to galaxy type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 1998 16:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A stochastic treatment of this classical fluctuations leads us to\na Fokker-Planck equation which is reminiscent of Kramers' equation for\nthermally activated processes. This reveals an interplay of three aspects of\nevolution of quantum noise in weakly dissipative open systems; the reversible\nLiouville flow, the irreversible chaotic diffusion which is characteristic of\nthe system itself, and irreversible dissipation induced by the external\nreservoir. It has been demonstrated that in the dissipation-free case a\ncompetition between Liouville flow in the contracting direction of phase space\nand chaotic diffusion sets a critical width in the Wigner function for quantum\nfluctuations. We also show how the initial quantum noise gets amplified by\nclassical chaos and ultimately equilibrated under the influence of dissipation.\nWe establish that there exists a critical limit to the expansion of phase\nspace.

We show that in the decoupling limit of the CFT/AdS correspondence,\nthe 4-dimensional transverse space of the NUT configuration in D=5 is foliated\nby surfaces that are cyclic lens spaces S^3/Z_N, where N is the quantised\nmonopole charge.

These measures can be regarded as generalizations\nof the classical Shannon-Wiener information of a probability distribution into\nthe quantum regime. In the present work we introduce a previously unknown\napproach to the Shannon-Wiener information which provides an intuitive\ninterpretation for its functional form as well as putting all entanglement\nmeasures with a similar structure into a new context: By formalizing the\nprocess of information gaining in a set-theoretical language we arrive at a\nmathematical structure which we call ''tree structures'' over a given set. On\neach tree structure, a tree function can be defined, reflecting the degree of\nsplitting and branching in the given tree. We show in detail that the\nminimization of the tree function on, possibly constrained, sets of tree\nstructures renders the functional form of the Shannon-Wiener information. This\nfinding demonstrates that entropy-like information measures may themselves be\nunderstood as the result of a minimization process on a more general underlying\nmathematical structure, thus providing an entirely new interpretational\nframework to entropy-like measures of information and entanglement. We suggest\nthree natural axioms for defining tree structures, which turn out to be related\nto the axioms describing neighbourhood topologies on a topological space. The\nsame minimization that renders the functional form of the Shannon-Wiener\ninformation from the tree function then assigns a preferred topology to the\nunderlying set, hinting at a deep relation between entropy-like measures and\nneighbourhood topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 1998 20:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 1998 12:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 1998 13:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2003 13:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Along these lines Blind and Blind have shown that\nunlike in the simplicial case, there are parity restrictions on the $f$-vectors\nof cubical polytopes. In particular, except for polygons, all even dimensional\ncubical polytopes must have an even number of vertices. Here this result is\nextended to a class of zonotopal complexes which includes simply connected odd\ndimensional manifolds. This paper then shows that the only modular equations\nwhich hold for the $f$-vectors of all d-dimensional cubical polytopes (and\nhence spheres) are modulo two. Finally, the question of which mod two equations\nhold for the $f$-vectors of PL cubical spheres is reduced to a question about\nthe Euler characteristics of multiple point loci from codimension one PL\nimmersions into the $d$-sphere.

The idea of adaptive walks in fitness landscapes\nhas triggered a vast amount of research and has led to many important insights\nabout the progress of evolution. Nevertheless, the small step to time-dependent\nfitness landscapes has most of the time not been taken. In this work, some\nelements of a theory of adaptive walks on changing fitness landscapes are\nproposed, and are subsequently applied to and tested on a simple family of\ntime-dependent fitness landscapes, the oscillating NK landscapes, also\nintroduced here. For these landscapes, the parameter governing the evolutionary\ndynamics is the fraction of static fitness contributions f_S. For small f_S,\nlocal optima are virtually non-existent, and the adaptive walk constantly\nencounters new genotypes, whereas for large f_S, the evolutionary dynamics\nreduces to the one on static fitness landscapes. Evidence is presented that the\ntransition between the two regimes is a 2nd order phase transition akin a\npercolation transition. For f_S close to the critical point, a rich dynamics\ncan be observed. The adaptive walk gets trapped in noisy limit cycles, and\ntransitions from one noisy limit cycle to another occur sporadically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 1998 10:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
