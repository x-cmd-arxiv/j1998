Over the same range of UV\nluminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z~4 and z~3\nare indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and the total\nintegrated UV luminosity densities (rho_{UV}(z=3)/rho_{UV}(z=4) = 1.1 +/-0.3).\nWe see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the star\nformation density inferred from fainter photometric Lyman-break galaxies in the\nHubble Deep Field (HDF). If the true luminosity density at z~4 is somewhat\nhigher than implied by the HDF, as our ground-based sample suggests, then the\nemissivity of star formation as a function of redshift is essentially constant\nfor all z>1 once internally consistent corrections for dust are made. This\nsuggests that there is no obvious peak in star formation activity, and that the\nonset of substantial star formation in galaxies occurs at z > 4.5.

The detection of\nextended dust discs in some radio galaxies provides information on their jet\norientation. Given this, the strength of the compact nuclear sources of FR I\nand BL Lacs can be compared with model predictions. As a pilot project, we\nselected five radio galaxies which show extended nuclear discs in the HST\nimages. The relative orientation of the projected radio-jets and of the\nextended nuclear discs indicates that they are not perpendicular, as the\nsimplest geometrical model would suggest, but that they form an angle of ~ 20 -\n40 degrees with the symmetry axis of the disc: a significant change of\norientation occurs between the innermost AGN structure and the kpc-scale.\nNevertheless, the discs appear to be useful indicators of the radio sources\norientation since the angles formed by the disc axis and the jet with the line\nof sight differ by only ~ 10 - 20 degrees.

The electronic transmission\nresonances in the energy minibands manifest more and more fragmented nature of\nthe transmittance with the change of system sizes. We claim that when a small\nperturbation is randomly present at a few number of sites, the nature of\nelectronic states will change and this can be understood by studying the\nelectronic transmittance with the change of system size. We report the\ndifferent critical states manifested in the size variation of the transmittance\ncorresponding to the resonant energies for both perfect and imperfect cases\nthrough multifractal scaling study for few of these resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 1998 07:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

The basic ingredient in the\ncollision--broadened line shape theory is the time dependent dipole\nautocorrelation function of the radiator-perturber system. The observed\nspectral intensity is the Fourier transform of this correlation function. A\nmodified form of the Wigner--Weyl isomorphism between quantum operators and\nphase space functions (Weyl symbols) is introduced in order to describe the\nquantum structure of this system. This modification uses a partial Wigner\ntransform in which the radiator-perturber relative motion degrees of freedom\nare transformed into a phase space dependence, while operators associated with\nthe internal molecular degrees of freedom are kept in their original Hilbert\nspace form. The result of this partial Wigner transform is called a mixed Weyl\nsymbol. The star product, Moyal bracket and asymptotic expansions native to the\nmixed Weyl symbol calculus are determined. The correlation function is\nrepresented as the phase space integral of the product of two mixed symbols:\none corresponding to the initial configuration of the system, the other being\nits time evolving dynamical value. There are, in this approach, two\nsemiclassical expansions -- one associated with the perturber scattering\nprocess, the other with the mixed symbol star product. These approximations are\nused in combination to obtain representations of the autocorrelation that are\nsufficiently simple to allow numerical calculation. The leading O(\\hbar^0)\napproximation recovers the standard classical path approximation for line\nshapes. The higher order O(\\hbar^1) corrections arise from the noncommutative\nnature of the star product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 1998 17:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Then\nappreciable deviations from the Landau-Zener probability $P_{LZ}$ are found to\nappear for large couplings only, when $P$ is very small; this explains why the\nLandau-Zener model is often seen to provide more accurate results than\nexpected.
