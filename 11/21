By exploiting properties of TCP, a TCP trunk\nprovides elastic and reliable transmission over a network, and automatically\nshares the network fairly with other competing trunks. Moreover, by aggregating\nuser flows into a single trunk flow, TCP trunking can significantly reduce the\nnumber of flows that the network needs to manage, thereby allowing use of\nsimplified management to achieve improved perfor mance. For example, when\ndealing with only a small number of TCP trunk flows, a router with a simple\nFIFO buffer can experience low packet loss rates.\n  A TCP trunk is a \"soft\" circuit in the sense that it requires no flow states\nto be maintained inside the network. Setting up a TCP trunk involves only\nconfiguring the two end nodes. This is in contrast with traditional methods of\nconfiguring circuits via signaling of network nodes.\n  A simple packet-dropping mechanism based on packet accounting at the\ntransmitter of a TCP trunk assures that, when the trunk reduces its bandwidth\nin response to network congestion, user TCP flows carried by the trunk will\nreduce their bandwidths by the same proportion. Simu lation results have\ndemonstrated that TCP trunks can provide improved network performance to users,\nwhile achieving high network utilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 1998 20:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, recent\nevidence for neutrino oscillations suggests the existence of light non-zero\nneutrino masses, which in turn suggests the need for a heavy mass scale via the\nseesaw mechanism. In this paper, we make several observations in this regard.\nFirst, we point out that allowing the right-handed neutrino to experience extra\nspacetime dimensions naturally permits the left-handed neutrino mass to be\npower-law suppressed relative to the masses of the other fermions. This occurs\ndue to the power-law running of the neutrino Yukawa couplings, and therefore\ndoes not require a heavy scale for the right-handed neutrino. Second, we show\nthat a higher-dimensional analogue of the seesaw mechanism may also be capable\nof generating naturally light neutrino masses without the introduction of a\nheavy mass scale. Third, we show that such a higher-dimensional seesaw\nmechanism may even be able to explain neutrino oscillations without neutrino\nmasses, with oscillations induced indirectly via the masses of the Kaluza-Klein\nstates. Fourth, we point out that even when higher-dimensional right-handed\nneutrinos are given a bare Majorana mass, the higher-dimensional seesaw\nmechanism surprisingly replaces this mass scale with the radius scale of the\nextra dimensions. Finally, we also discuss a possible new mechanism for\ninducing lepton-number violation by shifting the positions of D-branes in Type\nI string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 1998 00:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 1998 23:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 1999 00:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
