We argue that the short spin periods of the white dwarfs in\nthese objects indicate that they have weak magnetic fields, so the radius at\nwhich material is captured by the field lines is relatively small. Consequently\nthe footprints of the disc-fed accretion curtains on the white dwarf surface\nare large. The optical depths to X-ray emission within the accretion curtains\nare therefore lowest in the direction along the magnetic field lines, and\nhighest in the direction parallel to the white dwarf surface, such that the\nemission from the two poles conspires to produce double-peaked X-ray pulse\nprofiles. We emphasise that such a pulse profile is not a unique indicator of\ntwo-pole accretion however. Indeed, two-pole accretion onto smaller regions of\nthe white dwarf surface may be considered the `normal' mode of behaviour in a\ndisc-fed intermediate polar with a longer white dwarf spin period (and\ntherefore a higher field strength), resulting in a single-peaked pulse profile.\nCollating data on other intermediate polars, we may classify them into two\nsubsets.

First, the pull model is based on the request/response\nparadigm. It is typically used to perform data polling. Several commercial\nmanagement platforms already use Web technologies that rely on this model to\nprovide for ad hoc management; we demonstrate how to extend this to regular\nmanagement. Second, the push model is a novel approach which relies on the\npublish/subscribe/distribute paradigm. It is better suited to regular\nmanagement than the pull model, and allows administrators to conserve network\nbandwidth as well as CPU time on the management station. It can be seen as a\ngeneralization of the paradigm commonly used for notification delivery.\nFinally, we introduce the concept of the collapsed network management platform,\nwhere these two models coexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 1998 14:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
