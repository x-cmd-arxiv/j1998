The simulations demonstrate that time-dependent tidal\ngravitational field of the merging excites non-axisymmetric structure of the\ngalaxy, subsequently drives efficient transfer of gas to the central region,\nand finally triggers a secondary starburst.\n  This result provides not only a new mechanism of starbursts but also a close\nphysical relationship between the emergence of starburst galaxies and the\nformation of substructure in clusters. We accordingly interpret post-starburst\ngalaxies located near substructure of the Coma cluster as one observational\nexample indicating the global tidal effects of group-cluster merging.\n  Our numerical results furthermore suggest a causal link between the observed\nexcess of blue galaxies in distant clusters and cluster virialization process\nthrough hierarchical merging of subclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 1998 08:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
