We use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to\ncompute the expected evolution of the galaxy correlation function with\nredshift.

For a fixed apparent magnitude limit,\ngalaxies selected at higher redshifts are located in progressively rarer dark\nmatter haloes, compared with the general population of galaxies in place at\neach redshift. As a result these galaxies are highly biased tracers of the\nunderlying dark matter distribution and exhibit stronger clustering than the\ndark matter. In general, the correlation length measured in comoving units,\ndecreases at first with increasing redshift, before increasing again at higher\nredshift. We show that the epsilon-model often used to interpret the angular\ncorrelation function of faint galaxies gives an inadequate description of the\nevolution of clustering, and offers no physical insight into the clustering\nprocess.

Inspection of the exact Kahler potential of the\nclassical moduli space shows that the symmetry group of the moduli space is\nlarger than the global symmetry group of the underlying gauge theory. As a\nconsequence, the gauge theory has classical inequivalent vacua which yield\nidentical low energy theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 1998 20:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}
