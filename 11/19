The effects due to Pauli-Blocking and density, spin, and\nisospin correlations in the medium significantly reduce the neutrino cross\nsections. Due to the lack of experimental information at high density, these\ncorrelations are necessarily model dependent. For example, spin correlations in\nnonrelativistic models are found to lead to larger suppressions of neutrino\ncross sections compared to those of relativistic models. This is due to the\ntendency of the nonrelativistic models to develop spin instabilities.\nNotwithstanding the above caveats, and the differences between nonrelativistic\nand relativistic approaches such as the spin- and isospin-dependent\ninteractions and the nucleon effective masses, suppressions of order 2--3,\nrelative to the case in which correlations are ignored, are obtained.

Therefore the protection of a site\nrequires also a careful control of this emission which needs to be reduced to\nat most 1/10 of the remaining emission. The emission between the horizontal and\n10\\deg ~is mostly produced by spill light from luminaires, so fully shielded\nfixtures (e.g. flat glass luminaires or asymmetric spot-lights installed\nwithout any tilt) are needed for this purpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 1998 01:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

There are\ntwo different types of superconductivity in cuprates: superconductivity due to\npairing of spinons on charged stripes and magnetic superconductivity mediated\nby spin-waves. The coherent state of the spinon superconductivity is\nestablished via the magnetic superconductivity. In NCCO, there is only the\nspinon superconductivity and the coherent state is established due to the\nJosephson coupling between charged stripes. Below Tc, we observe four different\ngaps, namely, (i) a SDW gap due to antiferromagnetic correlations; (ii) a\nsuperconducting gap due to spinon pairing; (iii) a d-wave magnetic\nsuperconducting gap, and (iv) a small superconducting gap most likely having\ng-wave symmetry. We show that the d-wave superconductivity is mediated by\nspin-waves and the magnitude of the superconducting gap due to pairing of\nspinons is larger than the magnitude of the d-wave gap, however, the d-wave gap\nis more intense. The superconducting gap due to pairing of spinons most likely\nhas a s-wave symmetry.

The goal is to present a self-consistent set\nof coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations for atomic and electromagnetic fields\ngeneralized to include the atomic center-of-mass motion. Two effects are\nconsidered: The ultracold gas forms a medium for the Maxwell field which\nmodifies its propagation properties. Combined herewith is the influence of the\ndipole-dipole interaction between atoms which leads to a density dependent\nshift of the atomic transition frequency. It is expressed in a position\ndependent detuning and is the reason for the nonlinearity. This results in a\ndirect and physically transparent way from the quantum field theoretical\nversion of the local-field approach to electrodynamics in quantum media. The\nequations for the matter fields are general. Previously published nonlinear\nequations are obtained as limiting cases. As an atom optical application the\nscattering of a dense beam of a Bose gas is studied in the Raman-Nath regime.\nThe main conclusion is that for increasing density of the gas the dipole-dipole\ninteraction suppresses or enhances the scattering depending on the sign of the\ndetuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 1998 11:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

They are studied here from\nthe perspective of standard quantum mechanics, with no ontological\ninterpretation involved. Bohr's investigation of these gedanken experiments,\nbased on the uncertainty relation with his interpretation, was the origin of\nthe Copenhagen interpretation and is still widely adopted, but is shown to be\nnot consistent with the quantum mechanical view. We point out that in most of\nthese gedanken experiments, entanglement plays a crucial role, while its\nbuildup does not change the uncertainty of the concerned quantity in the way\nthought by Bohr. Especially, in the gamma ray microscope and recoiling\ndouble-slit gedanken experiments, we expose the entanglement based on momentum\nexchange. It is shown that even in such cases, the loss of interference is only\ndue to the entanglement with other degrees of freedom, while the uncertainty\nrelation argument, which has not been questioned up to now, is not right.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 1998 14:15:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 1999 18:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 1999 11:34:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2000 21:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}
