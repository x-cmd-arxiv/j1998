Three event samples are studied, each dominated by one of the\nprocesses W+W- to qqlnu, W+W- to qqqq, or (Z/g)* to qq. After demonstrating the\nexistence of Bose-Einstein correlations in W decays, an attempt is made to\ndetermine Bose-Einstein correlations for pions originating from the same W\nboson and from different W bosons, as well as for pions from (Z/g)* to qq\nevents. The following results are obtained for the individual chaoticity\nparameters lambda assuming a common source radius R: lambda_same = 0.63 +- 0.19\n+- 0.14, lambda_diff = 0.22 +- 0.53 +- 0.14, lambda_Z = 0.47 +- 0.11 +- 0.08, R\n= 0.92 +- 0.09 +- 0.09. In each case, the first error is statistical and the\nsecond is systematic. At the current level of statistical precision it is not\nestablished whether Bose-Einstein correlations, between pions from different W\nbosons exist or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 1998 08:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These operators are scaled by the fundamental Planck\nmass $M_{Pf}\\sim$ TeV and must be suppressed by the gauge family symmetries. We\nstudy suppression of the most dangerous and model-independent operators.\nSeveral points emerge. First, we show that the Abelian symmetries can not do\nthe job and one has to invoke non-Abelian $U(2)_F$ (or $U(3)_F$) symmetries.\nHowever, even in this case there emerge severe restrictions on the fermion\nmixing pattern and the whole structure of the theory. In order not to be\nimmediately excluded by the well-known bounds, the horizontal gauge fields {\\it\nmust} be the bulk modes, like gravitons. For the generic hierarchical breaking\npattern the four-fermion operators induced by the tree-level exchange of the\nbulk gauge fields are unsuppressed for $N = 2$. For $N > 3$ the suppression\nfactor goes as a square of the largest $U(2)_F$-non-invariant Yukawa coupling,\nwhich implies the lower bound $M_{Pf} > 10$ TeV or so from the $K^0 - \\bar K^0$\nsystem. Situation is different in the scenarios when flavor Higgs fields live\non a ($3 + N'$)-brane of lower dimensionality than the gauge fields. The\nfurther suppression of gauge-mediated operators can be achieved by an explicit\nconstruction: for instance, if $U(2)_F$ is broken by a vacuum expectation value\nof the doublet, the troublesome operators are suppressed in the leading order,\ndue to custodial SO(4) symmetry of the Higgs-gauge quartic coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 1998 23:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
