The results\nlead us to introduce a novel class of conformal field theories, identified by a\nclosed quantum conformal algebra. We conjecture that they are the exact\nsolution to the strongly coupled large-N_c limit of the open conformal field\ntheories. We study the basic properties of closed conformal field theory and\nwork out the operator product expansion of the conserved current multiplet T.\nThe OPE structure is uniquely determined by two central charges, c and a. The\nmultiplet T does not contain just the stress-tensor, but also R-currents and\nfinite mass operators. For this reason, the ratio c/a is different from 1. On\nthe other hand, an open algebra contains an infinite tower of non-conserved\ncurrents, organized in pairs and singlets with respect to renormalization\nmixing. T mixes with a second multiplet T* and the main consequence is that c\nand a have different subleading corrections. The closed algebra simplifies\nconsiderably at c=a, where it coincides with the N=4 one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 1998 15:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A {\\bf 58}, 3439 (1998)], is used\nto develop a general perturbative method for the study of atom-field\ninteraction in quantum optics. In fact, both Dyson series and its dual, through\nrenormalization group methods to remove secular terms from the perturbation\nseries, give the opportunity of a full study of the solution of the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation in different ranges of the parameters of the given\nhamiltonian. In view of recent experiments with strong laser fields, this\napproach seems well-suited to give a clarification and an improvement of the\napplications of the dressed states as currently done through the eigenstates of\nthe atom-field interaction, showing that these are just the leading order of\nthe dual Dyson series when the Hamiltonian is expressed in the interaction\npicture. In order to exploit the method at the best, a study is accomplished of\nthe well-known Jaynes-Cummings model in the rotating wave approximation, whose\nexact solution is known, comparing the perturbative solutions obtained by the\nDyson series and its dual with the same approximations obtained by Taylor\nexpanding the exact solution. Finally, a full perturbative study of high-order\nharmonic generation is given obtaining, through analytical expressions, a clear\naccount of the power spectrum using a two-level model, even if the method can\nbe successfully applied to a more general model that can account for ionization\ntoo. The analysis shows that to account for the power spectrum it is needed to\ngo to first order in the perturbative analysis.
