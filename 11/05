These parameters\nare crucial for the success of the algorithm. Our set of optimized parameters\ngives the same results as the most conservative choice, but is very fast.

This vortex state persists for many hours and\nwe have explicitly verified that the motion is not due to rotating waves of\ncAMP. To provide an alternative mechanism for the self-organization of the\nDictyostelium cells, we have developed a new model of the dynamics of\nself-propelled deformable objects. In this model, we show that cohesive energy\nbetween the cells, together with a coupling between the self-generated\npropulsive force and the cell's configuration produces a self-organized vortex\nstate. The angular velocity profiles of the experiment and of the model are\nqualitatively similar. The mechanism for self-organization reported here can\npossibly explain similar vortex states in other biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 1998 22:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 1999 21:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
