It makes sense at each completion of an arbitrary\nnumber field and arose in previous papers by the author where it was shown to\nbe intimately connected with the Explicit Formula of Analytic Number Theory. I\ncomplete here its spectral analysis: the conclusion is that the local\ncontribution to the Explicit Formula expressed as an integral over the critical\nline is completely equivalent to, indeed precisely realizes this spectral\nanalysis. In this picture the inversion is related to complex conjugation, the\nadditive Fourier transform is closely related to the Tate-Gel'fand-Graev Gamma\nfunction on the critical line, and the conductor operator itself is just the\nlogarithmic derivative of the Gamma function, again on the critical line,\nacting as a multiplier. From this one gets that the conductor operator is not\nonly dilation and Fourier invariant, which was obvious, but also inversion\ninvariant. In this manner, an operator theoretic and spectral interpretation of\neach local contribution to the Explicit Formula on the critical line has been\nobtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 1998 11:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 1998 13:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

They can be applied\nto a number of principal problems of modern astronomy and time-keeping\nmetrology. The full exploration of pulsar properties requires obtaining\nunbiased estimates of the spin and orbital parameters. These estimates depend\nessentially on the random noise component being revealed in the residuals of\ntime of arrivals (TOA). In the present paper, the influence of low-frequency\n(\"red\") timing noise with spectral indices from 1 to 6 on TOA residuals,\nvariances, and covariances of estimates of measured parameters of single and\nbinary pulsars are studied. In order to determine their functional dependence\non time, an analytic technique of processing of observational data in time\ndomain is developed which takes into account both stationary and non-stationary\ncomponents of noise. Our analysis includes a simplified timing model of a\nbinary pulsar in a circular orbit and procedure of estimation of pulsar\nparameters and residuals under the influence of red noise. We reconfirm that\nuncorrelated white noise of errors of measurements of TOA brings on gradually\ndecreasing residuals, variances and covariances of all parameters. On the other\nhand, we show that any red noise causes the residuals, variances, and\ncovariances of certain parameters to increase with time. Hence, the low\nfrequency noise corrupts our observations and reduces experimental\npossibilities for better tests of General Relativity Theory. We also treat in\ndetail the influence of a polynomial drift of noise on the residuals and\nfitting parameters. Results of the analitic analysis are used for discussion of\na statistic describing stabilities of kinematic and dynamic pulsar time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 1998 17:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 1999 12:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
