We\ndevelop the moment formalism of neutrino transport in the presence of such\nasymmetric opacities and derive explicit expressions for the neutrino flux and\nother angular moments of the Boltzmann transport equation.

In the region cospatial with the\nradio-jet the velocity field is highly perturbed and shows two velocity systems\nseparated by as much as 1700 km/s. We interpret this to be the consequence of\nthe rapid expansion of a cocoon of hot gas, shocked and heated by the\nradio-emitting outflow, which compresses and accelerates the ambient gas. The\nNLR itself is essentially a cylindrical shell expanding supersonically. From\nthe size and velocity of the expanding region, we derive an upper limit to the\nradio-source age, ~< 1.5 E5 years, and a lower limit for the jet power, ~> 2\nE42 erg/s required to inflate the cocoon and estimate that the jet minimum\nadvance speed is 3 E-3 pc per year. The total kinetic energy of the high\nvelocity NLR gas can be estimated as ~6 E54 erg, comparable to the total energy\ncarried by the jet over its lifetime and this quantitatively supports the idea\nthat the NLR gas is accelerated by the jet. If the advance speed of Mrk 3 is\nrepresentative of the Seyfert population then these sources must also be short\nlived and probably recurrent. The jet kinetic luminosity of Mrk 3 is between 2\nand 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for radio-loud AGNs with\nsimilar emission-line luminosity.

Higher-order effects are\nincorporated in an effective Z(3)-breaking field, $h$, which couples to the\nPolyakov loop.

Furthermore, in this picture it is possible for\nthe fundamental Planck mass $\\mst$ to be as small as the weak scale $\\mst\\simeq\nO(\\tev)$ and the observed weakness of gravity at long distances is due the\nexistence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. We show that in this\npicture it is natural to expect neutrino masses to occur in the $10^{-1} -\n10^{-4}\\ev$ range, despite the lack of any fundamental scale higher than\n$\\mst$. Such suppressed neutrino masses are not the result of a see-saw, but\nhave intrinsically higher-dimensional explanations. We explore two\npossibilities. The first mechanism identifies any massless bulk fermions as\nright-handed neutrinos. These give naturally small Dirac masses for the same\nreason that gravity is weak at long distances in this framework. The second\nmechanism takes advantage of the large {\\it infrared} desert: the space in the\nextra dimensions. Here, small Majorana neutrino masses are generated by\nbreaking lepton number on distant branes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 1998 00:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
