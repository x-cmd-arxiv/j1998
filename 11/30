In both wavebands\nthe irregular structure of Virgo can be decomposed into three major subclusters\ncentred on M87, M49, and M86. A new statistical method of subcluster\ndecomposition is applied. Radial galaxy and X-ray density profiles of the three\nsubclusters are fitted with beta-models, allowing analytic deprojection.\nComparison of these profiles reveals, that there is no general luminosity\nsegregation. The gas density profile is steeper than the galaxy density profile\nin the inner part, while this trend is reversed in the outer part. A comparison\namong the subclusters shows the poorer the subcluster the steeper its radial\nprofile, i.e. the more compact it is, both in the optical and the X-rays. The\nsubcluster profiles for different Hubble types confirm the well-known result\nthat the distribution of the late-type galaxies is more extended than the early\ntypes. Differential and integrated mass density profiles of the different\ncomponents in the M87 and M49 subclusters are presented. The total, gravitating\nmass is inferred from the distribution of the X-ray gas. In the M87 subcluster\nthe gas mass is about three times the mass in galaxies, while it accounts only\nfor 8% to 14% of the total mass at 0.4 and 1 Mpc, respectively. In the M49\nsubcluster there is more mass in the galaxies than in the gas and the\ngas-to-total mass fraction is only 1%, which is unusually low for a cluster.\nThe mass-to-light ratios show relatively constant values around 500Msol/Lsol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 1998 15:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
