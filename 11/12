The\nthermal structure of cooling and heating fronts is dominated by radiative\ncooling and viscous heating, respectively, except in a very narrow precursor\nregion in heating fronts where advection and radial transport of energy\ndominate. Cooling fronts are much broader than heating fronts, but the widths\nof both types of fronts scale with the local vertical scale height of the disc.\nWe confirm that during a fair fraction of the propagation time of a cooling\nfront, the structure of the inner disc is close to self-similar. The speed of\nheating fronts is ~ a few km/s, while the speed of cooling fronts is ~ a\nfraction of a km/s. We show that direct measurements of the speed of transition\nfronts probably cannot discriminate between various prescriptions proposed for\nthe viscosity parameter alpha. A natural prediction of the disc instability\nmodel is that fronts decelerate as they propagate in the disc, independent of\nthe prescription for alpha.

Here it is shown that most of those drawbacks\nare efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to\nthis problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization\nallows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions\nor the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases\nwhen the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate'\nthe prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an\nexcellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the\npredictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z_spec) = 0.08 up to z<6\nand no systematic biases nor outliers. The reliability of the method is further\ntested by restricting the color information to the UBVI filters. The results\nthus obtained are shown to be more reliable than those of standard techniques\neven when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed\nhere can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of\nphotometric redshifts. Several applications are outlined, e.g. the estimation\nof individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or\nthe study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large\nmulticolor surveys.

Using\nprobability theory we derive an expression for the expected pair separation\nhistogram (EPSH) in a rather general topological-geometrical-observational\nsetting. As a major consequence we show that the spikes of topological origin\nin PSH's are due to translations, whereas other isometries manifest as tiny\ndeformations of the PSH corresponding to the simply connected case. This result\nholds for all Robertson-Walker spacetimes and gives rise to two basic\ncorollaries: (i) that PSH's of Euclidean manifolds that have the same\ntranslations in their covering groups exhibit identical spike spectra of\ntopological origin, making clear that even if the universe is flat the\ntopological spikes alone are not sufficient for determining its topology; and\n(ii) that PSH's of hyperbolic 3-manifolds exhibit no spikes of topological\norigin. These corollaries ensure that cosmic crystallography, as originally\nformulated, is not a conclusive method for unveiling the shape of the universe.\nWe also present a method that reduces the statistical fluctuations in PSH's\nbuilt from simulated catalogues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 1998 20:54:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 1999 01:02:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2000 23:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2002 02:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

On LIGO\nscales, perturbations can only survive through thermal inflation with\ndetectable amplitudes if their amplitudes were at one time so large that linear\nperturbation theory is inadequate.

From the beginning, the problem is recast in terms of the\nconcept of a model, which is an algebra whose Poincar\\'e series is the\ngenerating function under study. We start by reviewing Sharp's character\nmethod. Simple examples are worked out in detail, illustrating thereby its\nintrinsic limitations. An alternative approach is then presented; it is based\non the reformulation of the problem of calculating tensor products in terms of\nthe solution of a set of linear and homogeneous Diophantine equations whose\nelementary solutions represent ``elementary couplings''. Grobner bases provide\na tool for generating the complete set of relations between elementary\ncouplings and, most importantly, as an algorithm for specifying a complete,\ncompatible set of ``forbidden couplings''. This machinery is then applied to\nthe construction of various tensor-product generating functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 1998 15:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
