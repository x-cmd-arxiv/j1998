Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae\nin hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a\nmember of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do\nnot vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as ``non-flickerers'' (NFs).\nLike the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the\ncluster center. Using stellar atmosphere models we have determined log g =\n6.25, and T_eff = 17,500 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the\nluminosity of the NF we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium\nWD having a mass of ~0.25 solar masses and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr\n(depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly\nDoppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a\ndark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen WD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 1998 16:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Within the picture of\nan effective field theory of strong interaction at intermediate energies I\npresent a ``toy-model'' in which fermionic and bosonic resonances are\nconsidered to be ``particles'', i.e. they consistently are described by\n(anti-)commuting effective field-operators (containing dynamics of infinitely\nmany quark-gluon or meson-nucleon diagrams) which are comfortably treated by\nWick's Theorem in a covariant framework and obey unitarity. Non-trivial\nimplications to couplings of non-local interactions are shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 1998 03:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
