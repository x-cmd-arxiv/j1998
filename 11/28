Recent models of the\nextreme scattering events - refraction of radio-waves from quasars in dense\nplasma clumps in the Galactic halo - definitely show on such clouds as possible\ndark matter candidate. We argue that collisions of such clumpuscules are quite\nfrequent: around $1-10 \\msun$ a year can be ejected in the interstellar medium\ndue to collisions. Optical continuum and 21 cm emissions from post-collisional\ngas are found to be observable. We show that clumpuscules can form around O\nstars HII regions of sizes $R\\sim 30$ pc and emission measure $EM\\simeq 20\ncm^{-6}$ pc, and can also be observable in $H_\\alpha$ emission. Evaporation of\nclumpuscules by external ionizing radiation can be a substantial mass source.\n  From requirement that the total mass input on the Hubble time cannot exceed\nthe luminous mass in the Galaxy, typical radius of clouds is constrained as\n$R_c < 3.5\\times 10^{12}$ cm, and their contribution to surface mass density as\n50 $\\msun pc^{-2}$. It is argued that dissipation of kinetic energy of the gas\nejected by such clouds can be an efficient energy source for the Galactic halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 1998 16:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 1998 19:37:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 1998 17:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
