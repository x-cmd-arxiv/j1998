B2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9\narcsec. A fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and its\npositional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy strongly\nsuggests that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. This implies that the\nB2045+265 system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source being lensed by\nanother flat-spectrum radio source. Infrared images detect the lensed images of\nthe background source and the lensing galaxy. The lensed images have relative\npositions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radio\nwavelengths. Spectra of the system reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and a\nsource redshift of z_s=1.28.

The RHD\nmodels provide information about the convective efficiency in the\nsuperadiabatic region at the top of convective envelopes and predict the\nasymptotic value of the entropy of the deep, adiabatically stratified layers.\nThis information is translated into an effective mixing-length parameter alpha\nsuitable to construct standard stellar structure models. We validate the\napproach by a detailed comparison to helioseismic data.\n  The grid of RHD models for solar metallicity comprises 58 simulation runs\nwith a helium abundance of Y=0.28 in the range of effective temperatures 4300K\n< Teff < 7100K and gravities 2.54 < logg < 4.74. We find a moderate,\nnevertheless significant variation of alpha between about 1.3 for F-dwarfs and\n1.75 for K-subgiants with a dominant dependence on Teff. In the close\nneighbourhood of the Sun we find a plateau where alpha remains almost constant.\nThe internal accuracy of the calibration of alpha is estimated to be +/- 0.05\nwith a possible systematic bias towards lower values. An analogous calibration\nof the convection theory of Canuto & Mazzitelli gives a different temperature\ndependence but a similar variation of the free parameter.\n  For the first time, values for the gravity-darkening exponent beta are\nderived independently of mixing-length theory: beta=0.07...0.10.\n  We show that our findings are consistent with constraints from stellar\nstability considerations and provide compact fitting formulae for the\ncalibrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 1998 13:46:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 1999 14:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Both steps are derived from the\nunderlying quark model. First, branching ratios for radiative protonium\nannihilation are calculated and compared with data. Then, details of the\nisospin interference are studied for different models of the initial protonium\nstate and also for different kinematical form factors. The isospin interference\nis shown to be uniquely connected to the $p\\bar p - n\\bar n $ mixing in the\nprotonium state. Values of the interference terms directly deduced from data\nare consistent with theoretical expectations, indicating a dominant $p\\bar p$\ncomponent for the $^1S_0$ and a sizable $n\\bar n$ component for the $^3S_1$\nprotonium state.
