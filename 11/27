Further, theoretical work on emerging\nspectra of Kerr-holes is required to replace the classical model used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 1998 14:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The technique, which we\ncall fractional stimulated Raman adiabatic passage ({\\it f-STIRAP}), is based\nupon (incomplete) adiabatic population transfer between an initial state\n$\\psi_1$ and state $\\psi_3$ through an intermediate state $\\psi_2$. As in\nSTIRAP, the Stokes pulse arrives before the pump pulse, but unlike STIRAP, the\ntwo pulses terminate simultaneously while maintaining a constant ratio of\namplitudes. The independence of f-STIRAP from details of pulse shape and pulse\narea makes it the analog of conventional STIRAP in the creation of coherent\nsuperpositions of states. We suggest a smooth realization of f-STIRAP which\nrequires only two laser pulses (which can be derived from a single laser) and\nat the same time ensures the automatic fulfillment of the asymptotic conditions\nat early and late times. Furthermore, we provide simple analytic estimates of\nthe robustness of f-STIRAP against variations in the pulse intensity, the pulse\ndelay, and the intermediate-state detuning, and discuss its possible extension\nto multistate systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 1998 14:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
