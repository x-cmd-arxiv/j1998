Unfortunately, perhaps the most intriguing system\nwhere such a tool could be used, a pulsar in orbit with a black hole, has yet\nto be discovered. In this paper we give a detailed investigation of what one\ncan learn about the black hole companion via timing observations of the pulsar.\nWe present an analytic calculation for the propagation delay caused by the\nframe-dragging effect and show that it has the same functional behavior as the\nmodulation of the observed rotational phase of the pulsar caused by the\ndeflection of the radio signals in the gravitational field of the companion\n(bending delay). Thus, contrary to statements of other authors, the\nframe-dragging delay is unlikely to be separately measurable in pulsar binaries\nwhere the companion is a stellar mass black hole. We demonstrate, however, that\nthe precession of the binary orbit caused by the relativistic spin-orbit\ncoupling can lead to observable effects which can be used to set a lower limit\nto the black-hole spin, or possibly allow the determination of its magnitude\nand orientation. We give parameter estimates for two possible systems, a 10\nsolar mass black hole in orbit either with a young (~0.1 s) pulsar or with a\nmillisecond pulsar. Finally, we discuss the measurability of the quadrupole\nmoment of the rotating black hole companion which would test the presence of a\nKerr black hole.
