We exploit the formal equivalence of constant angular momentum flows\nand simple Cartesian shear to examine the transition from stability to\nnonlinear instability. The manifestation of nonlinear instability in shear\nflows is known to be sensitive to initial perturbation and to the amount of\nviscosity; marginally (linearly) stable differentially rotating flows exhibit\nthis same sensitivity. Keplerian systems, however, are completely stable; the\nstrength of the stabilizing Coriolis force easily overwhelms any destabilizing\nnonlinear effects.

The properties of hydrodynamic differential rotation are\ncontrasted with magnetohydrodynamic differential rotation.

In\nSerganova's algorithm all mu with nonzero a_{lambda,mu} are determined for a\ngiven lambda; this algorithm turns out to be rather complicated. In this Letter\na simple rule is conjectured to find all nonzero a_{lambda,mu} for any given\nweight mu. In particular, we claim that for an r-fold atypical weight mu there\nare 2^r distinct weights lambda such that a_{lambda,mu}=1, and a_{lambda,mu}=0\nfor all other weights lambda. Some related properties on the multiplicities\na_{lambda,mu} are proved, and arguments in favour of our main conjecture are\ngiven. Finally, an extension of the conjecture describing the inverse of the\nmatrix of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 1998 09:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
