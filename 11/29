Thereafter, the line emission\nslowly decreased and the lines red-shift in a gradual phase that lasted at\nleast two more hours. The Mg II lines behaved similarly. Quiescent C IV flux\nlevels were not recovered until 21 hours later, though a data gap and a\npossible second flare make the interpretation uncertain. In addition to the\ntypically flare-enhanced emission lines (e.g., H_alpha and H_beta), we observe\nHe I D_3 going into emission, plus excess emission (after subtraction of the\nquiescent spectrum) in other He I and several strong neutral metal lines (e.g.,\nMg I b).

At weak compressibility, the\nexplosive separation of trajectories induces a familiar direct cascade of the\nenergy of a scalar tracer with a short-distance intermittency and dissipative\nanomaly. At strong compressibility, the implosive collapse of trajectories\nleads to an inverse cascade of the tracer energy with suppressed intermittency\nand with the energy evacuated by large scale friction. A scalar density whose\nadvection preserves mass exhibits in the two regimes opposite cascades of the\ntotal mass squared.
