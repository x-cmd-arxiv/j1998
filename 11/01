It is well known that the answer is ``no''\nin the case of Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in dimension two. In dimension\nthree it is still an open problem for these equations.\n  In this paper we focus on a two-dimensional active scalar model for the 3D\nEuler vorticity equation. Constantin, Majda and Tabak suggested, by studying\nrigorous theorems and detailed numerical experiments, a general principle: ``If\nthe level set topology in the temperature field for the 2D quasi-geostrophic\nactive scalar in the region of strong scalar gradients does not contain a\nhyperbolic saddle, then no finite time singularity is possible.''\n  Numerical simulations showed evidence of singular behavior when the geometry\nof the level sets of the active scalar contain a hyperbolic saddle. There is a\nnaturally associated notion of simple hyperbolic saddle breakdown. The main\ntheorem we present in this paper shows that such breakdown cannot occur in\nfinite time. We also show that the angle of the saddle cannot close in finite\ntime and it cannot be faster than a double exponential in time. Using the same\ntechniques, we see that analogous results hold for incompressible 2D and 3D\nEuler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 1998 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
