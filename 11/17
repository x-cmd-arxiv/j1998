We find that, even though\nprotons may be accelerated to such energies, their ejection into the\ninterstellar/intergalactic medium is problematic because it is likely to be\naccompanied by considerable adiabatic losses in the expanding shell. The\nproblem is circumvented by neutrons produced in photohadronic interactions,\nwhich are not magnetically bound and thus effectively ejected in the moment of\ntheir production. They can be both produced in sufficient number and be able to\nleave the emission region if the optical depth of the emission region to\nphotohadronic interactions is of order 1. We show that this requirement can be\nfulfilled under the same conditions which allow acceleration of protons to the\nhighest energies. The production of neutrinos in this process correlates the\nfluxes of cosmic rays and neutrinos, and makes the hypothesis of UHECR origin\nin GRBs testable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 1998 15:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-13"}

The abilities of our\nperturbation theory are illustrated by examples from quantum mechanics and\nfield theory. Considering the Coulomb potential $1/|x|$ the total reduction of\nquantum degrees of freedom is demonstrated mapping the dynamics in the (angle,\nangular momentum, Runge-Lentz vector) space.
