For the case of one atom\nbeing initially excited and the cavity mode in the vacuum state it is shown\nthat the atomic time evolution is dominated by the appearance of dark states.\nThese states, in which the initial excitation is stored in the internal atomic\ndegrees of freedom and the atoms become quantum mechanically entangled, are\nalmost immune against photon loss from the cavity. Various properties of the\ndark states within and beyond the Raman-Nath approximation of atom optics are\nworked out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 1998 23:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
