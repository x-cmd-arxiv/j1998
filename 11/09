The\nrenormalizability requires the nonminimal interaction of torsion with spinor\nand scalar (Higgs) fields. The Pauli-like equation contains new\ntorsion-dependent terms which have a different structure as compared with the\nstandard electromagnetic ones. The same concerns the nonrelativistic equations\nfor spin-${1}/{2}$ particle in an external torsion and electromagnetic fields.\nSecond, we discuss the propagating torsion. For the Dirac spinor coupled to the\nelectromagnetic and torsion field there is some additional softly broken local\nsymmetry associated with torsion. As a consequence of this symmetry, in the\nframework of effective field theory, the torsion action is fixed with accuracy\nto the values of the coupling constant of the torsion-spinor interaction, mass\nof the torsion and higher derivative terms. The introduction of the Higgs field\nspoils the consistency of this scheme, and the effective quantum field theory\nfor torsion embedded into the Standard Model is not possible.

One of the most unexpected is a procedure called\nquantum teleportation (Bennett et al 1993) that allows the quantum state of a\nsystem to be transported from one location to another, without moving through\nthe intervening space. Partial implementations of teleportation (Bouwmeester et\nal 1997, Boschi et al 1998) over macroscopic distances have been achieved using\noptical systems, but omit the final stage of the teleportation procedure. Here\nwe report an experimental implementation of the full quantum teleportation\noperation over inter-atomic distances using liquid state nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR). The inclusion of the final stage enables for the first time a\nteleportation implementation which may be used as a subroutine in larger\nquantum computations, or for quantum communication. Our experiment also\ndemonstrates the use of quantum process tomography, a procedure to completely\ncharacterize the dynamics of a quantum system.
