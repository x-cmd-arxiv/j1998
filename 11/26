Each agent\npossesses a number of fixed strategies each of which are predictors of the next\nminority group. The strategies use a set of aggregate, publicly available\ninformation (reflecting the agents' collective previous decisions) to make\ntheir predictions. An agent chooses which group to join at a given moment by\nusing one of his strategies. These games are adaptive in that agents can\nchoose, at different points of the game, to exercise different strategies in\nmaking their choice of which group to join. We find, rather generally, that\nsuch systems evidence a phase change from a maladaptive, informationally\nefficient phase in which the system performs poorly at generating resources, to\nan inefficient phase in which there is an emergent cooperation among the\nagents, and the system more effectively generates resources. The best emergent\ncoordination is achieved in a transition region between these two phases. This\ntransition occurs when the dimension of the strategy space is of the order of\nthe number of agents playing the game. We present explanations for this general\nbehavior, based in part on an information theoretic analysis of the system and\nits publicly available information. We also propose a mean-field like model of\nthe game which is most accurate in the maladaptive, efficient phase. In\naddition, we show that the best individual agent performance in the two\ndifferent phases is achieved by sets of strategies with markedly different\ncharacteristics. We discuss implications of our results for various aspects of\nthe study of complex adaptive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 1998 15:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The density-\nand order parameter dependence of the orientational elastic constants and their\nabsolute values are estimated. From the defect structure, one finds that the\nsplay elastic constant is smaller than the bend elastic constant (melanocytes).\nThe core of a disclination is either a cell free space or occupied by non\noriented cells (isotropic phase) or occupied by a cell with a different\nsymmetry or occupied by another cell type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 1998 16:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An intense correspondence between Hilbert and Einstein in the crucial\nmonth of November 1915, furthermore, confronts the historian with a case of\nparallel research and with the associated problem of reconstructing the\ninteraction between Hilbert and Einstein at that time.\n  Previous assessments of these issues have recently been challenged by Leo\nCorry, J\\\"urgen Renn, and John Stachel who draw attention to a hitherto\nunnoticed first set of proofs for Hilbert's note. These proofs bear a printer's\nstamp of December 6 and display substantial differences to the published\nversion. By focussing on the consequences of these findings for the\nreconstruction of Einstein's path towards general relativity, a number of\nquestions about Hilbert's role in the episode, however, are left open. To what\nextent did Hilbert react to Einstein? What were Hilbert's research concerns in\nhis note, and how did they come to overlap with Einstein's to some extent in\nthe fall of 1915? How did Hilbert and Einstein regard each other and their\nconcurrent activities at the time? What did Hilbert hope to achieve, and what,\nafter all, did he achieve?\n  With these questions in mind I discuss in this paper Hilbert's first note on\nthe ``Foundations of Physics,'' its prehistory and characteristic features,\nand, for heuristic purposes, I do so largely from Hilbert's perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 1998 12:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
