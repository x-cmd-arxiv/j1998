We use an\niterative procedure to reconstruct the intrinsic Star Formation Rate (SFR)\ndensity of galaxies with redshift, by applying dust obscuration corrections to\nthe observed UV emission. The iterative procedure converges to multiple\nsolutions for the intrinsic SFR density, divided into two basic classes. The\nfirst class of solutions predicts relatively large UV attenuation at high\nredshift, with A(1500 A)=1.9 mag at z~3, and smaller attenuations at z<1, with\nA(2800 A)=1.25 mag. The SFR density of this set of solutions is constant for\nz>~1.2 and declines for z<1.2; it resembles in shape the ``monolithic\ncollapse'' scenario for star formation.

The investigation of\nthese properties, and particularly the increasing influence of quantum effects\non electron transport, has therefore attracted much interest. Quantum\nproperties of the conductance can be observed when `breaking' a metallic\ncontact: as two metal electrodes in contact with each other are slowly\nretracted, the contact area undergoes structural rearrangements until it\nconsists in its final stages of only a few bridging atoms. Just before the\nabrubt transition to tunneling occurs, the electrical conductance through a\nmonovalent metal contact is always close to a value of 2e^2/h, where e is the\ncharge on an electron and h is Plack's constant. This value corresponds to one\nquantum unit of conductance, thus indicating that the `neck' of the contact\nconsists of a single atom. In contrast to previous observations of only\nsingle-atom necks, here we describe the breaking of atomic-scale gold contacts,\nwhich leads to the formation of gold chains one atom thick and at least four\natoms long. Once we start to pull out a chain, the conductance never exceeds\n2e^2/h, confirming that it acts as a one-dimensional quantized nanowire.
