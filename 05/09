We investigate an\ninside-out formation scenario in which the inner, low angular momentum material\nis assumed to form the bulge. Stability arguments are used to suggest that this\nbulge formation is a self-regulating process in which the bulge grows until it\nis massive enough to allow the remaining gas to form a stable disk component.\nWe search for the parameters and physical processes that determine the\ndisk-to-bulge ratio, and therewith explain to a large extent the origin of the\nHubble sequence. The spread in halo angular momenta coupled with a spread in\nthe formation redshifts can explain the observed spread in disk properties and\ndisk-to-bulge ratios from spirals to S0s. Disky ellipticals, however, are too\ncompact to be incorporated. Upon introducing a galaxy formation efficiency that\ndepends on redshift, as suggested by the small amount of scatter in the\nobserved Tully-Fisher relation, this scenario naturally predicts a\ndensity-morphology relation, the amplitude of which depends on the baryon\nfraction of the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 1998 22:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We\ninterpret these offsets as due to starquakes occurring as the star spins down\nand the rigid crust becomes less oblate. We study the evolution of strain in\nthe crust, the initiation of starquakes, and possible consequences for magnetic\nfield and torque evolution. Crust cracking occurs as equatorial material shears\nunder the compressive forces arising from the star's decreasing circumference,\nand matter moves to higher latitudes along a fault inclined to the equator. A\nstarquake is most likely to originate near one of the two points on the\nrotational equator farthest from the magnetic poles.

These machines produce two imperfect copies of a single state that\nemerge from two distinct Heisenberg channels. The tradeoff between the quality\nof these copies is shown to result from a complementarity akin to Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle. A no-cloning inequality is derived for isotropic\ncloners: if $\\pi_a$ and $\\pi_b$ are the depolarizing fractions associated with\nthe two copies, the domain in $(\\sqrt{\\pi_a},\\sqrt{\\pi_b})$-space located\ninside a particular ellipse representing close-to-perfect cloning is forbidden.\nMore generally, a no-cloning uncertainty relation is discussed, quantifying the\nimpossibility of copying imposed by quantum mechanics. Finally, an asymmetric\nPauli cloning machine is defined that makes two approximate copies of a quantum\nbit, while the input-to-output operation underlying each copy is a (distinct)\nPauli channel. The class of symmetric Pauli cloning machines is shown to\nprovide an upper bound on the quantum capacity of the Pauli channel of\nprobabilities $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 1998 23:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 1998 23:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
