Although the cut-out disks are remarkably stable\nto bisymmetric perturbations, they are very susceptible to one-armed modes. For\nthis harmonic, there is no inner Lindblad resonance, thus removing a powerful\nstabilising influence. A physical mechanism for the generation of the one-armed\ninstabilities is put forward. Incoming trailing waves are reflected as leading\nwaves at the inner cut-out, thus completing the feedback for the\nswing-amplifier. Growing three-armed and four-armed modes occur only at very\nlow temperatures. The rotation curve index has a marked effect on stability.\nFor all azimuthal wavenumbers, any unstable modes persist to higher\ntemperatures and grow more vigorously if the rotation curve is rising than if\nthe rotation curve is falling. If the central regions or outer parts of the\ndisk are carved out more abruptly, any instabilities become more virulent. The\nself-consistent power-law disks possess a number of unusual stability\nproperties. There is no natural time-scale in the self-consistent disk. If a\nmode is admitted at some pattern speed and growth rate, then it must be present\nat all pattern speeds and growth rates. Our analysis suggests that such a\ntwo-dimensional continuum of non-axisymmetric modes does not occur and that the\nself-consistent power-law disks admit no global non-axisymmetric normal modes\nwhatsoever. Without reflecting boundaries or cut-outs, there is no resonant\ncavity and no possibility of unstable growing modes. The self-consistent\npower-law disks certainly admit equiangular spirals as neutral modes, together\nwith a one-dimensional continuum of growing axisymmetric modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 1998 16:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here, we present an\ninvestigation into the microlensing characteristics of haloes with spatially\nvarying PDMFs and anisotropic velocity dispersion tensors. One attractive\npossibility -- suggested by baryonic dark cluster formation in pregalactic and\nprotogalactic cooling flows -- is that the inner halo is dominated by stellar\nmass objects, whereas low mass brown dwarfs become more prevalent on moving\noutwards. The contribution to the microlensing rate must be dominated by dark\nremnants (of about 0.5 solar masses) to recover the observed timescales of the\nmicrolensing experiments. But, even though stellar remnants control the rate,\nthey do not dominate the mass of the baryonic halo, and so the well-known\nenrichment and mass budget problems are much less severe. Using a simple ansatz\nfor the spatial variation of the PDMF, models are constructed in which the\ncontribution of brown dwarfs to the mass of the baryonic halo is 55 % and to\nthe total halo is 30 %. An unusual property of the models is that they predict\nthat the average timescale of events towards M31 is shorter than the average\ntimescale towards the LMC.

This would\nappear to stop the accumulation of central mass before it becomes large enough\nfor rapid loss of halo triaxiality.
