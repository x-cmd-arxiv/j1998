Previous studies of this problem have incorporated gravitational\ndynamics and adiabatic gas dynamics, but radiative cooling, an essential\nelement of the physics of galaxy formation, normally violates the conditions\nnecessary for self-similar evolution. We show that for any specified value of\nthe initial power spectrum index n [where P(k)~k^n], there is a family of\npower-law cooling functions that preserves self-similarity by ensuring that the\ncooling time in an object of the characteristic mass M_* is a fixed fraction\nt_C of the Hubble time.

The models are based on\nthe behavior of individual pedestrians, which depends on the pedestrian\nintentions and on the aspects of movement. The pedestrian intentions concerning\na sequence of destinations are influenced by the demand for certain kinds of\ncommodities, by the location of stores selling these, and by the expenditures\nto get the required commodities. The actual pedestrian movement starts and ends\nat special city entry points like parking lots. It is guided by the pedestrian\nintentions, but is subject to deceleration processes and avoidance maneuvers\ndue to obstacles. As a consequence, the pedestrians have to speed up to reach\nthe next destination well-timed. In addition, the pedestrian behavior is\ninfluenced by unexpected attractions (e.g. street artists). The model for the\nbehavior of individual pedestrians is an ideal starting point for computer\nsimulations of pedestrian crowds. Such simulations take into account the\nlimited capacity of pedestrian ways and places, and allow to determine an\noptimal design of pedestrian areas and an optimal arrangement of store\nlocations.

The\nmodel for the behavior of individual pedestrians also allows the derivation of\nmathematical equations for pedestrian crowds and for pedestrian groups.\nPedestrian crowds can be described by a stochastic formulation, by a gaskinetic\nformulation or by a fluiddynamic formulation.
