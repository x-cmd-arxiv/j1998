This invalidates the\n``standard'' analysis of the same catalogue given elsewhere by the authors\nwhich results in a ``correlation length'' of only r_0 = 4 Mpc/h. Furthermore we\nshow that the evidences for a cross-over to homogeneity rely on the choice of\ncosmological model, and most crucially on the so called K corrections. We show\nthat the D ~ 3 behaviour seen in the K-corrected data of Scaramella et al. is\nin fact unstable, increasing systematically towards D=4 as a function of the\nabsolute magnitude limit. This behaviour can be quantitatively explained as the\neffect of an unphysical K-correction in the relevant range of red-shift (z ~\n0.1- 0.3). A more consistent interpretation of the number counts is that D is\nin the range 2 - 2.5, depending on the cosmological model, consistent with the\ncontinuation of the fractal D ~ 2 behaviour observed at scales up to ~100\nMpc/h. This implies a smaller K-correction. Given, however, the uncertainty in\nthe effect of intrinsic fluctuations on the number counts statistic, and its\nsensitivity on these large scales to the uncertain K corrections, we conclude\nthat it is premature to put a definitive constraint on the galaxy distribution\nusing the ESP data alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 1998 11:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 1999 11:03:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 May 1999 13:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the\nstrong coupling limit we demonstrate how the SO(3)-symmetric description of\nspin ladders in terms of bond Bosons can be upgraded to an SO(5)-symmetric\nbond-Boson model, which provides a particularly simple example for the concept\nof SO(5) symmetry. Based on this representation we show that antiferro-\nmagnetism on one hand and superconductivity on the other hand can be understood\nas condensation of either magnetic or charged Bosons into an RVB vacuum. We\nidentify exact eigenstates of a finite cluster with general multiplets of the\nSO(5) group, and present numerical results for the single particle spectra and\nspin/charge correlation functions of the SO(5)-symmetric model and identify\n`fingerprints' of SO(5) symmetry in these. In particluar we show that SO(5)\nsymmetry implies a `generalized rigid band behavior' of the photoemission\nspectrum, i.e. spectra for the doped case are rigorously identical to spectra\nfor spin-polarized states at half-filling. We discuss the problem of adiabatic\ncontinuity between the SO(5) symmetric ladder and the actual t-J ladder and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of a `Landau mapping' between the two models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 1998 11:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We discuss several experiments in\nwhich the small capacitance of the junctions plays an important role. In arrays\nwhere the junctions have a relatively large charging energy, (i.e. when they\nhave a low capacitance) and a high normal state resistance, the low bias\nresistance increases with decreasing temperature and eventually at very low\ntemperature the array becomes insulating even though the electrodes in the\narray are superconducting. This transition to the insulating state can be\ndescribed by thermal activation. In an intermediate region where the junction\nresistance is of the order of the quantum resistance and the charging energy is\nof the order of the Josephson coupling energy, the arrays can be tuned between\na superconducting and an insulating state with a magnetic field. We describe\nmeasurements of this magnetic-field-tuned superconductor insulator transition,\nand we show that the resistance data can be scaled over several orders of\nmagnitude. Four arrays follow the same universal function. At the transition\nthe transverse (Hall) resistance is found to be very small in comparison with\nthe longitudinal resistance. However, for magnetic field values larger than the\ncritical value.we observe a substantial Hall resistance. The Hall resistance of\nthese arrays oscillates with the applied magnetic field. features in the\nmagnetic field dependence of the Hall resistance can qualitatively be\ncorrelated to features in the derivative of the longitudinal resistance,\nsimilar to what is found in the quantum Hall effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 1998 12:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This mechanism can be re-phrased in terms of the Casimir effect and has\nrecently been the subject of considerable controversy. The present paper probes\nSchwinger's suggestion in detail: Using the sudden approximation we calculate\nBogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum in the presence of the expanded\nbubble to that in the presence of the collapsed bubble. In this way we derive\nan estimate for the spectrum and total energy emitted. We verify that in the\nsudden approximation there is an efficient production of photons, and further\nthat the main contribution to this dynamic Casimir effect comes from a volume\nterm, as per Schwinger's original calculation. However, we also demonstrate\nthat the timescales required to implement Schwinger's original suggestion are\nnot physically relevant to sonoluminescence. Although Schwinger was correct in\nhis assertion that changes in the zero-point energy lead to photon production,\nnevertheless his original model is not appropriate for sonoluminescence. In\nother works (see quant-ph/9805023, quant-ph/9904013, quant-ph/9904018,\nquant-ph/9905034) we have developed a variant of Schwinger's model that is\ncompatible with the physically required timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 1998 14:19:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 1999 10:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
