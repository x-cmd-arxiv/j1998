We prove the existence of an upper bound on\nthe partition function for holons in a spinon background, and we find the\noptimal spinon configuration saturating the upper bound on average--a\ncoexisting flux phase and s+id-like RVB state. After neglecting the feedback of\nholon fluctuations on the U(1) field B and spinon fluctuations on the SU(2)\nfield V, the holon field is a fermion and the spinon field is a hard--core\nboson. We show that the B field produces a \\pi flux phase for holons,\nconverting them into Dirac--like fermions, while the V field, taking into\naccount the feedback of holons produces a gap for spinons vanishing in zero\ndoping limit. The nonlinear sigma-model with a mass term describes the\ncrossover from short-ranged antiferromagnetic (AF) state in doped samples to\nlong range AF order in reference compounds. Moreover, we derive a low--energy\neffective action in terms of spinons, holons and a self-generated U(1) gauge\nfield. The gauge fluctuations are not confining due to coupling to holons, but\nyield an attractive interaction between spinons and holons leading to a bound\nstate with electron quantum numbers. The renormalisation effects due to gauge\nfluctuations give rise to non--Fermi liquid behaviour for the composite\nelectron.This formalism provides a new interpretation of the spin gap in\nunderdoped superconductors (due to short-ranged AF order) and predicts the\nminimal gap for the physical electron is proportional to the square root of the\ndoping concentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 1998 15:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These results suggest that\nthe experimentally observed positive correlation signal cannot be caused by the\nCoulomb interaction between pions emitted from the interaction zone. But other\nprocesses which involve long-lived resonances and the related extended source\ndimensions could provide a possible explanation for the observed signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 1998 12:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here a reorganization of the system takes place and a\nseparation of different time scales appears. We investigate it under the\ninfluence of additional weakly coupled channels as well as by taking into\naccount the real part of the coupling term between system and continuum. We\nobserve a saturation of the mean width of the trapped states. Also the decay\nrates saturate as a function of the coupling strength. The mechanism of the\nsaturation is studied in detail. In any case, the critical region of\nreorganization is enlarged. When the transmission coefficients for the\ndifferent channels are different, the width distribution is broadened as\ncompared to a chi_K^2 distribution where K is the number of channels. Resonance\ntrapping takes place before the broad state overlaps regions beyond the\nextension of the spectrum of the closed system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 1998 13:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-15"}
