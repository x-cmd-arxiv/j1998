We calibrate our RR Lyr distance scale\nwith the recent calibration of Gould and Popowski (1998) based on statistical\nparallaxes. We obtain the following distance moduli to the Galactic bulge, LMC\nand SMC: m-M=14.53+/-0.15, m-M=18.09+/-0.16 and m-M=18.66+/-0.16 mag.\n  We use the RR Lyr mean V-band luminosity at the Galactic bulge metallicity as\nthe reference brightness and analyze the mean, I-band luminosity of the red\nclump stars in objects with different ages and metallicities. We add to our\nanalysis the metal poor Carina dwarf galaxy which contains old RR Lyr stars and\nintermediate age red clump population. We find a weak dependence of the mean\nred clump brightness on metallicity and we calibrate its zero point with the\nnearby local red clump stars measured by Hipparcos: M^{RC}_I=(0.09+/-0.03)\n*[Fe/H]^{RC}-0.23+/-0.03.
