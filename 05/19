The majority of\nthe outburst profiles are strikingly different from the classical form, with\nits fast rise and slow decay. Some of the light curves appear quasi-persistent,\nwhich suggests that they are associated with secular changes in the accretion\nrate from the donor star rather than with a cyclic instability in the accretion\ndisk. The nature of the compact object is uncertain in many cases, but there is\na likelihood that the majority of new sources are black hole systems, while the\nmajority of recurrent transients contain neutron stars. There is a correlation\nbetween the gross shape of the energy spectrum, as seen in the ASM hardness\nratio, HR2 (5-12 keV / 3-5 keV), and the accretion subclass. These data, with\nimportant contributions from SAX, CGRO, and Granat, provide a deeper probe of\nthe X-ray sky than has been available previously.

A discussion of\n  systematic biases in galaxy redshift determinations","comments":"12 pages, 5 figures, Astronomy & Astrophysics, in press","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":"BAP 05-1998-018-OAB","categories":"astro-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  We present a detailed discussion of the redshift errors associated to the ESO\nSlice Project measurements. For a subsample of 742 galaxies with redshifts\ndetermined both from the absorption lines (V_{abs}) and from the emission lines\n(V_{emi}), we find an average difference <V_{abs} - V_{emi}> ~ +100$ km/s. We\nfind that a similar effect is present in another, deeper redshift survey, the\nDurham/Anglo-Australian Telescope faint galaxy redshift survey, while is absent\nin surveys at brighter magnitude limits. We have investigated in detail many\npossible sources of such a discrepancy, and we can exclude possible zero-point\nshifts or calibration problems. We have detected and measured systematic\nvelocity differences produced by the different templates used in the\ncross-correlation. We conclude that such differences can in principle explain\nthe effect, but in this case the non-trivial implication would be that the\nbest-fitting template does not necessarily give the best velocity estimate. As\nwe do not have any a priori reason to select a template different from the\nbest-fitting one, we did not apply any correction to the ESO Slice Project\nvelocities. However, as for a small number of galaxies the effect is so large\nthat it is likely to have a physical explanation, we have also taken into\naccount the possibility that the discrepancy can be partly real: in this case,\nit might help to understand the role of gas outflows in the process of galaxy\nevolution. In view of the future large spectroscopic surveys, we stress the\nimportance of using different templates and making them publicly available, in\norder to assess the amplitude of systematic effects, and to allow a direct\ncomparison of different catalogues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 1998 15:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The first is due to\nthe nonlocalities in the relativistic kinetic energy and relativistic one-pion\nexchange potential (OPEP), and the second is from boost interaction. The OPEP\ncontribution is reduced by about 15% by the relativistic nonlocality, which may\nalso have significant effects on pion exchange currents.
