A physical baryon in this model\nconsists of interacting valence quarks, mesons and a color and chiral singlet\nhybrid field coexisting inside a dynamically generated confining region. This\nfirst paper presents the quark contribution to the masses and wave functions of\nnegative parity baryons calculated with an effective spin--isospin dependent\ninstanton induced interaction. It does not include meson exchanges between\nquarks. The three--quark wave functions are used to calculate meson--excited\nbaryon vertex functions to lowest order in meson--quark coupling. When the\nbaryons are on mass--shell each of these vertex functions is a product of a\ncoupling constant and a form factor. As examples, quark contributions to $N^*$\nhadronic form factors as well as axial coupling constants are extracted from\nthe vertex functions and problems with the analytical behaviour of the model\nform factors are discussed. The second paper will examine the mesonic\ncorrections to excited baryon properties in the heavy baryon and one--loop\napproximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 1998 14:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nnatural unity of being is recovered within a universal nonperturbative method\nleading to the dynamic redundance paradigm. It is shown that the unreduced\nbehaviour of any nontrivial (isolated) system includes many equally real, but\nincompatible dynamic regimes, each of them being roughly equivalent to an\nordinary 'complete' solution of the unitary science. Therefore the regimes\nshould 'spontaneously' and randomly replace one another, which provides a\nuniversal, purely dynamic origin of randomness. The discovered dynamic\nredundance leads to the universal, reality-based concept of dynamic complexity\nand its permanently developing hierarchical structure, alias the world. Its\nlowest levels give the causally complete mechanics of dynamically quantized\nelementary fields, extending the double solution found by Louis de Broglie. One\nobtains a physically complete solution for the 'mysteries' of quantum\nmechanics, unifyng it with the extended, causal versions of relativity\n(emergent space and time), quantum and classical gravity (dynamical mass),\nfield theory (electric charge and spin), particle physics, and cosmology.
