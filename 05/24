The behavior of the neutrino distribution\nfunction transitions from an LTE distribution in the center of the core to a\nnon-LTE distribution in the outer regions of the core. One method that has been\nrecently employed in order to model the flow of neutrinos in 2-D models is the\ngray approximation. This approximation assumes that the neutrino distribution\ncan be described by a function that is parameterized in terms of a neutrino\ntemperature and a neutrino chemical potential. However, these parameters must\nbe assumed. Furthermore, the parameters will also differ between the LTE and\nNLTE regions. Additionally, within the gray approximation the location at which\nthe neutrino distribution function transitions from LTE to NLTE must be\nassumed. By considering a series of models where the LTE/NLTE decoupling point\nis varied we show that the outcome of the numerical models is critically\nsensitive to the choice of the decoupling point when the gray approximation is\nemployed. We also examine the effects of the neutrino--electron scattering\n(NES) rate which is difficult to correctly formulate within the gray\napproximation. We show that NES has a dramatic affect on the the overall\nneutrino heating rate and the dynamics of the model. This result conflicts with\nthe results of high resolution multi-group models which model neutrino\ntransport without employing the gray approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 1998 04:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To reduce the masses,\nthe transverse velocity of the lenses with respect to the microlensing tube\nmust be minimised. In the outer halo, radial anisotropy is best for doing this;\ncloser to the solar circle, azimuthal anisotropy is best. By using a constraint\non the total kinetic energy of the tracer population from the Jeans equations,\nthe microlensing mass is minimised over orientations of the velocity dispersion\ntensor. This minimum mass is about a tenth of a solar mass, which lies above\nthe hydrogen burning limit. This demonstrates explicitly that populations of\nbrown dwarfs with smoothly decreasing densities and dynamically mixed velocity\ndistributions cannot be responsible for the microlensing events. Brown dwarfs\nare no white knights! There is one caveat. If there are demons sitting on the\nmicrolensing tube, they can drop brown dwarfs so as to reproduce the\nmicrolensing data-set exactly. Such a distribution is not smooth and does not\ngive well-mixed velocities in phase space. It is a permissible solution only if\nthe outer halo is dynamically young and lumpy. In such a case, theorists cannot\nrule out brown dwarfs. Only exorcists can!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 1998 14:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The rotation curve can be rising, falling or\nflat. The self-consistent power-law disks are scale-free, so that all physical\nquantities vary as a power of radius. They possess simple equilibrium\ndistribution functions depending on the two classical integrals, energy and\nangular momentum. While maintaining the scale-free equilibrium force law, the\npower-law disks can be transformed into cut-out disks by preventing stars close\nto the origin (and sometimes also at large radii) from participating in any\ndisturbance. This paper derives the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation for\nthe in-plane normal modes in the self-consistent and the cut-out power-law\ndisks. This is done by linearising the collisionless Boltzmann equation to find\nthe response density corresponding to any imposed density and potential. The\nnormal modes -- that is, the self-consistent modes of oscillation -- are found\nby requiring the imposed density to equal the response density. In practice,\nthis scheme is implemented in Fourier space, by decomposing both imposed and\nresponse densities in logarithmic spirals. The Fredholm integral equation then\nrelates the transform of the imposed density to the transform of the response\ndensity. Numerical strategies to solve the integral equation and to isolate the\ngrowth rates and the pattern speeds of the normal modes are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 1998 15:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}
