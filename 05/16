The results are analyzed and compared with the\nz=0.2279 rich cluster Abell 2390. MS1621.5+2640 has a higher blue fraction, a\nyounger stellar population, and is a less evolved cluster. We do not find\nstrong evidence of significant excess star formation compared with the field,\nalthough there is a small population of outlying near-members that is unusually\nblue and that may be affected by the cluster. There is a substantial population\nof red galaxies with significant Hdelta absorption, which are not easily\nexplained by any simple form of modeled star formation history. We detect two\ndistinct populations of cluster galaxies: those where star formation ceased\nsome time ago, and those with a gradual decrease over many Gyr. Our data\nsuggests that the cluster formed by accretion from the field, with truncation\nof the star formation beginning at very large radii (>2 times the virial\nradius). The truncation process does not seem to be a sharp one though, in that\nlower-luminosity early-type galaxies in the inner core of the cluster are seen\nwith significant Hdelta absorption, indicating some star formation within the\nlast 1-2 Gyr. Some combination of stripping of gas from the outer parts of the\ngalaxy, together with gradual exhaustion of the gas in the inner parts would be\nconsistent with our data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 1998 20:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

As a result, we obtained for the\nDP a closed analytical expression valid for all principal quantum numbers, n.\nWithin a framework of such an approach we succeeded both in retrieving the well\nknown results and finding several new ones, as well.Our interest is focused\nmainly on the states with low n, n=1,2, since they are of particular\nimportance.Various analytical properties of the DP of such levels are discussed\nin full details.
