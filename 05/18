We calculate the\ntimescales for growth of linear perturbations due to gravitational radiation\nreaction, and for dissipation by shear and bulk viscosity, working to second\norder in a slow-rotation expansion within a Newtonian polytropic stellar model.\nThe results are very temperature-sensitive: in hot neutron stars ($T>10^9$ K),\nthe lowest-order $r$-modes are unstable, while in colder stars they are damped\nby viscosity. These calculations have a number of interesting astrophysical\nimplications. First, the $r$-mode instability will spin down a newly born\nneutron star to a period close to the initial period inferred for the Crab\npulsar, probably between 10 and 20 ms. Second, as an initially rapidly rotating\nstar star spins down, an energy equivalent to roughly 1% of a solar mass is\nradiated as gravitational waves, which makes the process an interesting source\nfor detectable gravitational waves. Third, the $r$-mode instability rules out\nthe scenario whereby millisecond pulsars are formed by accretion-induced\ncollapse of a white dwarf: the new star would be hot enough to spin down to\nmuch slower rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 1998 17:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The general construction of the Lax pairs applicable\nto all models based on the simply-laced algebras (ADE) are given for two types\nwhich we call `root' and `minimal'. The root type Lax pair is new; the matrices\nused in its construction bear a resemblance to the adjoint representation of\nthe associated Lie algebra, and exist for all models, but they do not contain\nelements associated with the zero weights corresponding to the Cartan\nsubalgebra. The root type provides a simple method of constructing sufficiently\nmany number of conserved quantities for all models, including the one based on\n$E_{8}$, whose integrability had been an unsolved problem for more than twenty\nyears. The minimal types provide a unified description of all known examples of\nCalogero-Moser Lax pairs and add some more. In both cases, the root type and\nthe minimal type, the formulation works for all of the four choices of\npotentials: the rational, trigonometric, hyperbolic and elliptic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 1998 06:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 1998 07:07:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 1998 07:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This biological system can be regarded as a\nreaction-diffusion system which has spatial interaction by active flow of\nprotoplasmic sol in the cell. Paying attention to the physiological evidence\nthat the flow is determined by contraction pattern in the plasmodium, a\nreaction-diffusion system having self-determined flow arises. Such a coupling\nof reaction-diffusion-advection is a characteristic of the biological system,\nand is expected to relate with control mechanism of amoeboid behaviours. Hence,\nwe have studied effects of the self-determined flow on pattern formation of\nsimple reaction-diffusion systems. By weakly nonlinear analysis near a trivial\nsolution, the envelope dynamics follows the complex Ginzburg-Landau type\nequation just after bifurcation occurs at finite wave number. The flow term\naffects the nonlinear term of the equation through the critical wave number\nsquared. Contrary to this, wave number isn't explicitly effective with lack of\nflow or constant flow. Thus, spatial size of pattern is especially important\nfor regulating pattern formation in the plasmodium. On the other hand, the flow\nterm is negligible in the vicinity of bifurcation at infinitely small wave\nnumber, and therefore the pattern formation by simple reaction-diffusion will\nalso hold.
