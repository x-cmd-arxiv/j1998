We show that the antisymmetric tensor (corresponding to conformal\ninvariance) generally gives rise to repulsion, and it precisely cancels the\ndominant attractive term arising from the metric.\n  Both the sinh-Gordon and the cosh-Gordon sectors of the string dynamics in\nnon-conformally invariant AdS spacetime reduce here to the Liouville equation\n(with different signs of the potential), while the original Liouville sector\nreduces to the free wave equation. Only the very large classical string size is\naffected by the torsion. Medium and small size string behaviours are unchanged.\n  We also find illustrative classes of string solutions in the SL(2,R)\nbackground: dynamical closed as well as stationary open spiralling strings, for\nwhich the effect of torsion is somewhat like the effect of rotation in the\nmetric.
