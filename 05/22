An extension of this type of star formation history\nallows us to reconcile the small present-day scatter of the CMR with the\nobserved blue galaxy fractions of intermediate redshift galaxy clusters.\n  Secondly, the CMR can also be used to constrain the degree of merging between\npre-existing stellar systems. This test relies on the slope of the CMR. We show\nthat random mergers between galaxies very rapidly remove any well-defined CMR.\nHowever, we prefer to examine the merger process using a self-consistent merger\ntree.

As a result of both of these effects,\nthe CMR persists through a larger number of merger steps.

Moreover, once\nthere are states that `exist' and can be `found out', a `collapse' in the\ntraditional sense is no longer necessary --- in effect, it has already\nhappened. The records of the observer will contain evidence of an effective\ncollapse. The role of the preferred states in the processing and storage of\ninformation is emphasized. The existential interpretation based on the\nrelatively objective existence of stable correlations between the einselected\nstates of observers memory and in the outside Universe is formulated and\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 1998 22:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

It is shown, further, that, given\nany quantum probability space and any set of commuting events in it which are\ncorrelated with respect to a fixed quantum state, the quantum probability space\ncan be extended in such a way that the extension contains common causes of all\nthe selected correlations, where common cause is again taken in the sense of\nReichenbach's definition.

Therefore in broadcasting of classical information by a quantum\nchannel an additional contribution to the error in the decoding is expected. We\nconsider the optimal copying transformation which is adapted to classical\ninformation transmission by two linearly independent quantum states, and show\nthat there is no additional contribution to the error. Instead the clones are\ncorrelated, and this breaks their usefulness: The entanglement increases with\nnon-orthogonality of the states. The capacity of the corresponding quantum\nchannel is considered also.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 1998 10:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
