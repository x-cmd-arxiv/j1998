We\ntherefore conclude that, within the frame work of Einstein's theory of gravity\nin (2+1) dimensions, formation of structures cannot take place.

The mean field in\nrelativistic transport calculations is derived from microscopic Dirac-Brueckner\n(DB) self-energies, taking non-equilibrium effects, in particular the\nanisotropy of the local phase space configurations, into account. Thus this\napproach goes beyond the local density approximation. A detailed analysis of\nvarious in-plane and out-of-plane flow observables is presented for Au on Au\nreactions at incident energies ranging from 250 to 800 A.MeV and the results\nare compared to recent measurements of the FOPI collaboration. An overall good\nagreement with in-plane flow data and a reasonable description of the\nout-of-plane emission is achieved. For these results the intrinsic momentum\ndependence of the non-equilibrium mean fields is important. On the other hand,\nthe local density approximation with the same underlying DB forces as well as a\nstandard non-linear version of the $\\sigma\\omega$ model are less successful in\ndescribing the present data. This gives evidence of the applicability of self\nenergies derived from the DB approach to nuclear matter also far from\nsaturation and equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 1998 16:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 1999 15:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-10"}
