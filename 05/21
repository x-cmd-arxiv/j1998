In what has been called the \"Generalized Wind\nBlown Bubble\" (GWBB) scenario, a fast tenuous wind from the central star\nexpands into a ambient medium with an aspherical (toroidal) density\ndistribution. Inertial gradients due to the gaseous torus quickly lead to an\nexpanding prolate or bipolar shell of swept-up gas bounded by strong shock\nwaves. Numerical simulations of the GWBB scenario show a surprisingly rich\nvariety of gasdynamical behavior, allowing models to recover many of the\nobserved properties of stellar bipolar outflows including the development of\ncollimated supersonic jets.\n  In this paper we review the physics behind the GWBB scenario in detail and\nconsider its strengths and weakness.

Applications of these models to each of the principle\nclasses of stellar bipolar outflow (YSO, PNe, LBV, SN87A) are then reviewed.\nOutstanding issues in the study of bipolar outflows are considered as are those\nquestions which arise when the outflows are viewed as a single class of\nphenomena occuring across the HR diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 1998 21:32:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We make a detailed study of two, moment-based `shape\nstatistics' proposed, respectively, by Babul & Starkman (BS) and Luo & Vishniac\n(LV) and find that both LV and BS have certain built-in limitations: LV is\nbiased towards oblate structures and tends to overemphasise this property;\nneither BS nor LV correctly describe the shape of strongly curved or\ntopologically nontrivial objects. For instance, a thin filamentary torus and a\nribbon are both described by BS and LV as being pancakes ! By contrast\nShapefinders, a new shape diagnostic not constructed from density moments but\nfrom Minskowski functionals, does not suffer from these limitations and appears\nto faithfully reproduce the shapes of both simple and topologically complex\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 1998 10:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Axiomatizing this, we define_conformal fields_ as arbitrary families\nof partial operators in Mer(M) which satisfy both these properties.\n  The ``variety'' M related to standard vertex operators is formed by rational\nfunctions of one variable z in Z=P^1, changing the variety Z one obtains\ndifferent examples of M, and multidimensional analogues of vertex operators.\nOne can cover Mer(M) by ``big smooth subsets''; these subsets are parameterized\nby appropriate projective bundles over Hilbert schemes of points on Z. We\ndeduce conformal associativity relation for conformal fields, and conformal\ncommutation relations for Laurent coefficients of commuting conformal fields\nfrom geometric properties of the Hilbert schemes.\n  We start with providing examples of OPE in smooth families, i.e., smooth\nfamilies a(s) and b(t) (of partial linear operators) such that a(s)b(t) has a\npole when s=t. We also provide geometric description of boson-fermion\ncorrespondence, and relations of this correspondence to geometry of the set of\nmeromorphic functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 1998 07:05:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 2002 02:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
