In this picture the\nacceleration arises as a consequence of the shearing motion of the magnetic\nfield in the corona, which is anchored in the underlying Keplerian disk. The\nprotons in the corona have a power-law distribution because the density there\nis too low for proton-proton collisions to thermalize the energy supplied via\nFermi acceleration. The same shear acceleration mechanism also operates in the\ndisk itself, however, there the density is high enough for thermalization to\noccur and consequently the disk protons have a Maxwellian distribution.\nParticle acceleration in the corona leads to the development of a\npressure-driven wind that passes through a critical point and subsequently\ntransforms into a relativistic jet at large distances from the black hole. We\ncombine the critical conditions for the wind with the structure equations for\nthe disk and the corona to obtain a coupled disk/corona/wind model.
