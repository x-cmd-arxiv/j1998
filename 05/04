Analytical and numerical results\nfor the rate of energy loss are presented. This is done for strong and weak\nfields (i. e., when the electron cyclotron frequency is either higher, or\nsmaller than the plasma frequency), and in case, when the test particle\nvelocity is greater than the electron thermal velocity. It is shown that the\nrate of energy loss may be much higher than in the case of motion through\nplasma in the absence of magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 1998 05:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
