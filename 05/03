Stellar trajectories undergo tiny perturbation, the origin of which\nis twofold: (i) gravitational field of a thin gaseous disc surrounding the\ngalactic centre, and (ii) cumulative drag due to successive interactions of the\nstars with material of the disc. Both effects are closely related because they\ndepend on the total mass of the disc, assumed to be a small fraction of the\ncentral mass. It is shown that, in contrast to previous works, most of the\nretrograde (with respect to the disc) orbits are captured by the central\nobject, presumably a massive black hole. Initially prograde orbits are also\naffected, so that statistical properties of the central star cluster in\nquasi-equilibrium may differ significantly from those deduced in previous\nanalyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 1998 19:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Using Wigner\npicture of the dynamics we distinguish between two different mechanisms for\ndestruction of coherence. The analysis of dephasing is extended to the low\ntemperature regime by using a semiclassical strategy. Various results are\nderived for ballistic, chaotic, diffusive, both ergodic and non-ergodic motion.\nWe also analyze loss of coherence at the limit of zero temperature and clarify\nthe limitations of the semiclassical approach. The condition for having\ncoherent effect due to scattering by low-frequency fluctuations is also pointed\nout.
