According\nto the prevailing understanding of cosmic string dynamics in an expanding\nUniverse, the network of long strings loses its energy first into string loops,\nwhich in turn give off most of their energy as gravitational radiation.\nHowever, it has been suggested by Vincent et al. (VHS) that particle emission\nmay be the dominant energy loss channel for the long string network. In this\ncase, the predicted flux of high energy particles would be much larger. Here we\ncalculate the predicted flux of high energy gamma rays, neutrinos and cosmic\nray antiprotons and protons as a function of the scale of symmetry breaking at\nwhich the strings are produced and as a function of the initial energy m_J of\nthe particle jets which result from the string decay. Assuming the validity of\nthe VHS scenario, we find that due to the interactions with the cosmic\nradiation backgrounds all fluxes but the neutrino flux are suppressed at the\nhighest energies. This indicates that the observed events above the GZK cutoff\ncan only be accounted for in this scenario if the primary particle is a\nneutrino and the scale of the symmetry breaking is somewhat less than the GUT\nscale. The domain of parameter space corresponding to GUT-scale symmetry\nbreaking is excluded also by the current observations below the GZK cutoff.

With respect to the\ncurrent-algebra derivation, the crucial role of the infinite-momentum limit is\npointed out. A derivation is presented that exhibits the infinite-momentum\nlimit as its last step, opening the prospect of studying its legitimacy within\nperturbative models. Adopting the Weinberg-Salam model as a testing ground, it\nis shown that a modification due to an anomalous charge-density commutator is\nremedied owing to the infinite-momentum limit. This finding is confirmed upon\nconsidering $t$-channel exchange of axial-vector mesons. Several other aspects\nof possible sources of modifications are investigated.

The motivation for this study came\nfrom attempts to generalize the structure of the category of relations to\nhandle what might be called ``probabilistic relations''. The compact closed\nstructure associated with the category of relations does not generalize\ndirectly, instead one obtains nuclear ideals. We introduce the notion of\nnuclear ideal to analyze these classes of morphisms. In compact closed\ncategories, we see that all morphisms are nuclear, and in the category of\nHilbert spaces, the nuclear morphisms are the Hilbert-Schmidt maps.\n  We also introduce two new examples of tensored *-categories, in which\nintegration plays the role of composition. In the first, morphisms are a\nspecial class of distributions, which we call tame distributions. We also\nintroduce a category of probabilistic relations which was the original\nmotivating example.\n  Finally, we extend the recent work of Joyal, Street and Verity on traced\nmonoidal categories to this setting by introducing the notion of a trace ideal.\nFor a given symmetric monoidal category, it is not generally the case that\narbitrary endomorphisms can be assigned a trace. However, we can find ideals in\nthe category on which a trace can be defined satisfying equations analogous to\nthose of Joyal, Street and Verity.

We then review nine basic experimental\nmeasurements which are necessary for a scientific appraisal of AquaFuel. We\noutline the limitations of quantum mechanics and chemistry for the treatment of\n{\\it new} forms of energy, namely, energies which by definition should be {\\it\nbeyond} said theories. We finally point out the availability of broader\ntheories specifically constructed for the study of new energies and point out\navailable applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 1998 12:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this scheme\nthe total entanglement i.e. the amount of singlet pairs needed for local\npreparation of a state corresponds to internal energy while the free\nentanglement defined as the number of pairs which can be recovered from the\nstate (distillable entanglement) is the counterpart of free energy. In\nparticular, it leads us to the question about ``temperature'' of entanglement.\nWe also propose a scheme of the search of representative state for given\nentanglement which can be viewed as an analogue of the Jaynes maximum entropy\nprinciple.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 1998 19:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The condition that a realization admits a\nfinite-dimensional invariant subspace of functions seems to act as a kind of\nquantization condition on this H^1. It was known that this quantization of\ncohomology holds for all realizations on 2-dimensional homogeneous spaces, but\nthe extent to which quantization of cohomology is true in general was an open\nquestion. The present article presents the first known counter-examples to\nquantization of cohomology; it is shown that quantization can fail even if the\nLie algebra is semi-simple, and even if the homogeneous space in question is\ncompact. A explanation for the quantization phenomenon is given in the case of\nsemi-simple Lie algebras. It is shown that the set of classes in H^1 that admit\nfinite-dimensional invariant subspaces is a semigroup that lies inside a\nfinitely-generated abelian group. In order for this abelian group be a discrete\nsubset of H^1, i.e. in order for quantization to take place, some extra\nconditions on the isotropy subalgebra are required. Two different instances of\nsuch necessary conditions are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 1998 01:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 1998 13:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
