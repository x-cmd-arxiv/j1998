This paper describes procedures\nfor removing the Galactic IR emission from the 1.25 - 240 micron COBE DIRBE\nmaps as steps toward the ultimate goal of detecting the CIB. The Galactic\nemission models are carefully chosen and constructed so that the isotropic CIB\nis completely retained in the residual sky maps. We start with DIRBE data from\nwhich the scattered light and thermal emission of the interplanetary dust (IPD)\ncloud have already been removed. Locations affected by the emission from bright\ncompact and stellar sources are excluded from the analysis. The unresolved\nemission of faint stars at near- and mid-IR wavelengths is represented by a\nmodel based on Galactic source counts. The 100 micron DIRBE observations are\nused as the spatial template for the interstellar medium (ISM) emission at high\nlatitudes. Correlation of the 100 micron data with H I column density allows us\nto isolate the component of the observed emission that is associated with the\nISM. Limits are established on the far-IR emissivity of the diffuse ionized\nmedium, which indicate a lower emissivity per H nucleus than in the neutral\nmedium. At 240 micron, we find that adding a second spatial template to the ISM\nmodel can greatly improve the accuracy of the model at low latitudes. The\ncrucial product of this analysis is a set of all-sky IR maps from which the\nGalactic (and IPD) emission has been removed. We discuss systematic\nuncertainties and potential errors in the foreground subtraction process that\nmay have an impact on studies seeking to detect the CIB in the residual maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 1998 20:32:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 1998 17:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
