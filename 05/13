Optical spectra of these\nnewly-discovered HII regions are used to investigate their densities,\nionization parameters, extinctions and in particular their oxygen and nitrogen\nabundances. Our measurements reveal gas-phase abundances of O/H~10-15% of the\nsolar value, and N/O~20-25% of the solar value, at radii of 1.5-2 R25. Clear\nevidence also exists for diminished dust extinction (Av~0-0.2) at large radii.\nThe combination of our measurements of outer disk HII region abundances with\nthose for inner disk HII regions published in the literature is a powerful\nprobe of the shape of abundance gradients over unprecedented radial baselines.\nWithin the limits of the current dataset, the radial abundance variations are\nconsistent with single log-linear relationships, although the derived slopes\ncan often differ considerably from those found if only inner disk HII regions\nare used to define the fit. Interestingly, both the mean level of enrichment\nand the ratio of N/O measured in extreme outer galactic disks are similar to\nthose values measured in some high redshift damped Lyman-alpha absorbers,\nsuggesting that outer disks at the present epoch are relatively unevolved.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 1998 11:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
