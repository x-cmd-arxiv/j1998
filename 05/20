The underlying universal mechanism for these changes is clarified by\nthe spatial change of the co-moving Lyapunov exponent, with which the condition\nfor the input dependence is formulated. The mechanism has a remarkable\ndependence on the noise strength, and works only within its medium range.\nRelevance of our mechanism to intra-cellular signal dynamics is discussed, by\nmaking our dynamics correspond to the auto-catalytic biochemical reaction for\nthe chemical concentration, and the input to the external signal, and the noise\nto the concentration fluctuation of chemicals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 1998 11:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The He-Li temperatures, measured recently by the ALADIN group, are\nreproduced fairly well both as a function of excitation energy and bound\ncharge. Our analysis confirms the anomaly in the nuclear caloric curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 1998 17:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
