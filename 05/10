Good fits are readily found, although for a few galaxies minor\nadjustments to the inclination are needed. Reasonable values for the stellar\nmass-to-light ratios are found, as well as an approximately constant value for\nthe total (gas and stars) mass-to-light ratio. We show that the LSB galaxies\ninvestigated here lie on the one, unique Tully-Fisher relation, as predicted by\nMOND. The scatter on the Tully-Fisher relation can be completely explained by\nthe observed scatter in the total mass-to-light ratio. We address the question\nof whether MOND can fit any arbitrary rotation curve by constructing a\nplausible fake model galaxy. While MOND is unable to fit this hypothetical\ngalaxy, a normal dark halo fit is readily found, showing that dark matter fits\nare much less selective in producing fits. The good fits to rotation curves of\nLSB galaxies support MOND, especially as these are galaxies with large mass\ndiscrepancies deep in the MOND regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 1998 02:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
