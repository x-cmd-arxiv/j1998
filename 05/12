We find that galaxy evolution\ncan be statistically described as nearly pure luminosity evolution of early and\nintermediate SED types, and nearly pure density evolution of the late SED\ntypes. The correlation of blue galaxies relative to red galaxies is similar on\nlarge scales but drops by a factor of three on scales less than about 0.3/h\nmpc, approximately the mean scale of virialization. There is a clear, but\nsmall, 60%, change in clustering with 1.4 mag of luminosity. To minimize these\npopulation effects in our measurement of clustering evolution, we choose\ngalaxies with M_r^{k,e}<= -20 mag as a population whose members are most likely\nto be conserved with redshift. Remarkably, the evolution of the clustered\ndensity in proper co-ordinates at r < 10/h Mpc, proportional to r_0^gamma\n(1+z)^3, is best described as a ``de-clustering'', (1+z)^{0.6+/-0.4}.

The satellite does\nlittle damage to the disk until its decaying orbit resonantly excites\nlarge-scale disk bending waves. Bending waves can damp through dynamical\nfriction from the halo or internal wave-particle resonances; we find that\nwave-particle resonances dominate the damping. The principal vertical heating\nmechanism is therefore dissipation of bending waves at resonances with stellar\norbits in the disk. Energy can thus be deposited some distance from the point\nof impact of the satellite. The net heating from a tightly bound satellite can\nbe substantial, but satellites that are tidally disrupted before they are able\nto excite bending waves do not thicken the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 1998 11:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The lattice consists of two types of sites\n-- one good conducting (type 1) and the other poor conducting (type 2),\ndistributed at random. The two types of sites are assigned different waiting\ntimes ($\\tau_{1}$ for type 1 and $\\tau_{2}$ for type 2) . We assume that at\nintervals of time $\\tau_{r}$, the site distribution changes. The effect of this\nrearrangement on the diffusion coefficient is studied with varying $\\tau_{r}$.\nWe study this effect for different ratios of dwell times of the two types of\nsites (R) and also for different fractions (X) of the less conducting sites. An\nempirical relation for D($\\tau_{1}$ ,$\\tau_{2}$,$\\tau_{r}$,X) is suggested. We\nhave employed the well model and considered diffusion controlled by sites,\nrather than bonds. So our approach is different from the dynamic bond\npercolation model, which studies these aspects. Our results show that the\ndiffusion coefficient D may change by a factor of upto 3 (approximately) for\nrapid rearrangement, and there is a considerable effect of varying X and R on\nthe range of variation of D, where X is the fraction of low conducting sites,\nand R is the ratio of the dwell times for the two types of sites. Further for\n$\\tau_{r}$ > 250$\\tau$ ($\\tau$ is the time unit for the random walk) the effect\nof rearrangement becomes negligible. The results may be useful for studying\ndiffusion and conduction of ion conducting polymers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 1998 14:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These negative energy\ndensities lead to many problems. Although quantum field theory introduces\nnegative energies, it also provides constraints in the form of quantum\ninequalities (QI's). These uncertainty principle-type relations limit the\nmagnitude and duration of any negative energy. We derive a general form of the\nQI on the energy density for both the quantized scalar and electromagnetic\nfields in static curved spacetimes. In the case of the scalar field, the QI can\nbe written as the Euclidean wave operator acting on the Euclidean Green's\nfunction. Additionally, a small distance expansion on the Green's function is\nused to derive the QI in the short sampling time limit. It is found that the QI\nin this limit reduces to the flat space form with subdominant correction terms\nwhich depend on the spacetime geometry.\n  Several example spacetimes are studied in which exact forms of the QI's can\nbe found. These include the three- and four-dimensional static Robertson-Walker\nspacetimes, flat space with perfectly reflecting mirrors, Rindler and static de\nSitter space, and the spacetime outside a black hole. Finally, the application\nof the quantum inequalities to the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime leads to\nstrict constraints on the thickness of the negative energy region needed to\nmaintain the warp drive. Under these constraints, we discover that the total\nnegative energy required exceeds the total mass of the visible universe by a\nhundred billion times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 1998 20:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, the\nsystems differ from general relativity in that spacetime is a combinatorial\nobject, constructed by piecing together copies of finitely many types of\nallowed neighborhoods in a prescribed manner. Hence at least initially there is\nno metric. The role of diffeomorphism is played by a combinatorial equivalence\nmap which is local and preserves information content. Most of my results come\nin the 1+1-dimensional oriented case. There sets of spaces may be described\nequivalently by matrices of nonnegative integers, directed graphs, or symmetric\ntensors; local equivalences between space sets are generated by simple matrix\ntransformations. These equivalence maps turn out to be closely related to the\nflow equivalence maps between subshifts of finite type studied in symbolic\ndynamics.

The main objective is to provide a substitute for the most\nspace-demanding module of the existing software which attempts to find a\nshortlex-automatic structure for a group. The two-variable automaton can be\nused to store an infinite set of rules and to carry out fast reduction of\narbitrary words using this infinite set. We introduce a new operation, which we\ncall welding, which applies to an arbitrary finite state automaton. In our\ncontext this operation is vital. We point out a small potential improvement in\nthe subset algorithm for making a non-deterministic automaton deterministic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 1998 12:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These procedures have been shown to be completely equivalent to the\nmaster equation approach when ensemble averages are taken over many\nrealizations. We show that these techniques are not only convenient\nmathematical tools for dissipative systems, but may actually correspond to\nconcrete physical processes, for any temperature of the reservoir. We consider\na mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity interacting with a beam of two-\nor three-level atoms, the field mode playing the role of a small system and the\natomic beam standing for a reservoir at finite temperature, the interaction\nbetween them being given by the Jaynes-Cummings model. We show that the\nevolution of the field states, under continuous monitoring of the state of the\natoms which leave the cavity, can be described in terms of either the Monte\nCarlo Wave-Function (quantum jump) method or a stochastic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, depending on the system configuration. We also show that the Monte\nCarlo Wave-Function approach leads, for finite temperatures, to localization\ninto jumping Fock states, while the diffusion equation method leads to\nlocalization into states with a diffusing average photon number, which for\nsufficiently small temperatures are close approximations to mildly squeezed\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 1998 21:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
