Thus, the transmission coefficient of particles over the\npotential barrier undergoes oscillatory behavior in time before settling into a\nsteady state. Recently Kohen and Tannor (JCP Vol. 103, Pg. 6013, 1995)\ndeveloped a method based on the phase space distribution function to calculate\nthe transmission coefficient as a function of time in the high-friction regime.\nHere we formulate a parallel method for the low-friction regime. We find\nanalytic results for the full time and temperature dependence of the rate\ncoefficient in this regime. Our low-friction result at long times reproduces\nthe equilibrium result of Kramers at very low friction and extends it to higher\nfriction and lower temperatures below the turn-over region. Our results\nindicate that the single most important quantity in determining the entire time\nevolution of the transmission coefficient is the rate of energy loss of a\nparticle that starts above the barrier.
