During the various stages of its\noutburst the X-rays lag the optical by ~5-20 days. Moreover, the activity\nassociated with the secondary maximum started even earlier in the infra-red.\nThis suggests that most of the outburst processes occur in the outer parts of\nthe disk.

However, studies of the internal geometry of black\nholes indicate a more complicated structure is typical. While it seems likely\nthat an observer falling into a black hole with the collapsing star encounters\na crushing spacelike singularity, an observer falling in at late times\ngenerally reaches a null singularity which is vastly different in character to\nthe standard Belinsky, Khalatnikov and Lifschitz (BKL) spacelike singularity.\nIn the spirit of the classic work of BKL we present an asymptotic analysis of\nthe null singularity inside a realistic black hole. Motivated by current\nunderstanding of spherical models, we argue that the Einstein equations reduce\nto a simple form in the neighborhood of the null singularity. The main results\narising from this approach are demonstrated using an almost plane symmetric\nmodel. The analysis shows that the null singularity results from the blueshift\nof the late-time gravitational wave tail; the amplitude of these gravitational\nwaves is taken to decay as an inverse power of advanced time as suggested by\nperturbation theory. The divergence of the Weyl curvature at the null\nsingularity is dominated by the propagating modes of the gravitational field.\nThe null singularity is weak in the sense that tidal distortion remains bounded\nalong timelike geodesics crossing the Cauchy horizon.

Earlier criticisms of the idea are\ndiscussed and their relevance to the proposal assessed. Several constraints on\nmeasuring apparatus required by \"protective\" measurements are discussed, with\nemphasis on how they may restrict their experimental feasibility. Though\n\"protective\" measurements result in an unchanged system state and a shift of\nthe pointer proportional to the expectation value of the measured observable in\nthe system state, the actual reading of the pointer position gives rise to\nseveral subtleties. We propose several schemes for reading pointer position,\nboth when the apparatus is treated as a classical system as well as when its\nquantum aspects are taken into account, that address these issues. The tiny\nentanglement which is always present due to deviation from extreme adiabaticity\nin realistic situations is argued to be the weakest aspect of the proposal.\nBecause of this, one can never perform a protective measurement on a single\nquantum system with absolute certainty. This clearly precludes an ontological\nstatus for the wave function. Several other conceptual issues are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 1998 20:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 1998 04:55:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 1998 16:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 1998 05:45:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2011 11:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-24"}
