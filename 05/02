At low b a single central disc formed initially,\nand was then spun-up by an accretion flow, causing it to produce secondaries\nvia rotational instabilities. At mid b the shocked layer w hich formed\ninitially broke up into fragments, and discs were then formed via fragment\nmerger. At large b single objects formed within the compressed leading edge of\neach clump. These became unbound from each other as b was increased further.\n  The effect of changing numerical factors was examined by : (i) colliding\nclumps which had been re-oriented before the collision (thus altering the\ninitial particle noise), and (ii) by quadrupling the number of particles in\neach clump (thus increasing the resolution of the simulation). Both changes\nwere found to affect the small-scale details of a collision, but leave the\nlarge scale morphology largely unaltered.\n  It was concluded that clump-clump collisions provide a natural mechanism by\nwhich multiple protostellar systems may form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 1998 17:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
