We find\nthat interactions between discs and stars provide a mechanism for removing\nenergy from, or adding energy to, the orbits of the stars, and for truncating\nthe discs. However, capture during such encounters is unlikely to be an\nimportant binary formation mechanism.\n  A more significant consequence of such encounters is that they can trigger\nfragmentation of the disc, via tidally and compressionally induced\ngravitational instabilities, leading to the formation of additional stars. When\nthe disc-spins and stellar orbits are randomly oriented, encounters lead to the\nformation of new companions to the original star in 20% of encounters. If most\nencounters are prograde and coplanar, as suggested by simulations of\ndynamically-triggered star formation, then new companions are formed in\napproximately 50% of encounters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 1998 14:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In particular,\nif the base manifold is almost complex, we prove a vanishing theorem for the\nkernel of a $\\spin^c$ Dirac operator twisted by a line bundle with curvature of\na mixed sign. In this case we also relax the assumption of non-degeneracy of\nthe curvature. These results are generalization of a vanishing theorem of\nBorthwick and Uribe. As an application we obtain a new proof of the classical\nAndreotti-Grauert vanishing theorem for the cohomology of a compact complex\nmanifold with values in the sheaf of holomorphic sections of a holomorphic\nvector bundle, twisted by a large power of a holomorphic line bundle with\ncurvature of a mixed sign.\n  As another application we calculate the sign of the index of a signature\noperator twisted by a large power of a line bundle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 1998 22:32:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 1998 16:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The bifurcation sequence as a function of $h$ found in the\nexperiment confirms the qualitative aspects of the theoretical predictions.\nHowever, the value of $h_{ct}$ is about 10% higher than the predicted value and\nthe results for $k_c$ are systematically below the theory by about 2% at small\n$h$ and by as much as 7% near $h_{ct}$.
