After\nreviewing their observational properties, we analyse the different regimes that\nlikely characterise the neutron stars in these systems across the very large\nrange of mass inflow rates, from the peak of the outbursts to the quiescent\nemission. While it is clear that close to the outburst maxima accretion onto\nthe neutron star surface takes place, as the mass inflow rate decreases,\naccretion might stop at the magnetospheric boundary because of the centrifugal\nbarrier provided by the neutron star. For low enough mass inflow rates (and\nsufficiently short rotation periods), the radio pulsar mechanism might turn on\nand sweep the inflowing matter away. The origin of the quiescent emission,\nobserved in a number of SXRTs at a level of ~10^(32)-10^(33) erg/s, plays a\ncrucial role in constraining the neutron star magnetic field and spin period.\nAccretion onto the neutron star surface is an unlikely mechanism for the\nquiescent emission of SXRTs, as it requires very low magnetic fields and/or\nlong spin periods. Thermal radiation from a cooling neutron star surface in\nbetween the outbursts can be ruled out as the only cause of the quiescent\nemission. We find that accretion onto the neutron star magnetosphere and shock\nemission powered by an enshrouded radio pulsar provide far more plausible\nmodels. In the latter case the range of allowed neutron star spin periods and\nmagnetic fields is consistent with the values recently inferred from the\nproperties of kHz QPO in LMXRBs. If quiescent SXRTs contain enshrouded radio\npulsars, they provide a missing link between X-ray binaries and millisecond\npulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 1998 17:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

For sufficiently strong dipole moments one finds a region where\na fluid phase with long-ranged orientational order is stable. For all sample\nshapes with the exception of a long thin needle this phase exhibits a spatially\ninhomogeneous magnetization which depends on the actual shape.

Both are generically defined locally by outer trapping horizons,\ntemporal for wormholes and spatial or null for black and white holes. Thus\nwormhole horizons are two-way traversible, while black-hole and white-hole\nhorizons are only one-way traversible. It follows from the Einstein equation\nthat the null energy condition is violated everywhere on a generic wormhole\nhorizon. It is suggested that quantum inequalities constraining negative energy\nbreak down at such horizons. Wormhole dynamics can be developed as for\nblack-hole dynamics, including a reversed second law and a first law involving\na definition of wormhole surface gravity. Since the causal nature of a horizon\ncan change, being spatial under positive energy and temporal under sufficient\nnegative energy, black holes and wormholes are interconvertible. In particular,\nif a wormhole's negative-energy source fails, it may collapse into a black\nhole. Conversely, irradiating a black-hole horizon with negative energy could\nconvert it into a wormhole horizon. This also suggests a possible final state\nof black-hole evaporation: a stationary wormhole.

Possible distortions of\nthe spectrum investigated in current detectors are often interpreted in terms\nof evidence in favour or against various schemes of neutrino oscillations. We\nstress here that a distortion of the spectrum at high energies could also\nresult from an increase in the ratio of neutrinos originating from ($^3$He+p)\nand $^8$B reactions. While a $^8$B neutrino depletion would contribute to this\neffect, an increase in the Hep contribution seems also needed to reproduce the\npreliminary data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 1998 16:33:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 1998 18:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 1998 18:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

As formulated quantum mechanics is a\nstatistical theory. In general, a priori unknown states can be completely\ndetermined only when measurements on infinite ensembles of identically prepared\nquantum systems are performed. But how one can estimate (guess) quantum state\nwhen just incomplete data are available (known)? What is the most reliable\nestimation based on a given measured data? What is the optimal measurement\nproviding only a finite number of identically prepared quantum objects are\navailable? These are some of the questions we address. We present several\nschemes for a reconstruction of states of quantum systems from measured data:\n(1) We show how the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle can be efficiently used\nfor an estimation of quantum states on incomplete observation levels. (2) We\nshow how Bayesian inference can be used for reconstruction of quantum states\nwhen only a finite number of identically prepared systems are measured. (3) We\ndescribe the optimal generalized measurement of a finite number of identically\nprepared quantum systems which results in the estimation of a quantum state\nwith the highest fidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 1998 13:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
