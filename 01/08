Such a scenario, which arises naturally if star\nformation in dwarf galaxies is delayed by photoionisation due to the\nmetagalactic UV radiation field, provides an attractive way to reconcile the\nEinstein-de Sitter cosmological model to the steeply rising galaxy counts\nobserved at blue wavelengths.

We compare the model predictions for the counts, sizes,\nand colours of galaxies observed in the HDF, and to the predictions from a low\nq_0 pure-luminosity-evolution (PLE) model.

Comparison of the different HDF catalogs available in the\nliterature and on the world-wide-web reveals generally good agreement, although\nthe effects of different isophotal thresholds and different splitting\nalgorithms are readily apparent. As the basic source detection and photometry\nalgorithms are similar for the different catalogs, the selection effects are\nlikely to affect them all. Through simulations, we explore the utility of image\nmoments for inferring the true sizes of galaxies. The truncation of galaxy\nprofiles at a fixed isophote has serious consequences, which limit constraints\non the size distribution to galaxies with isophotal magnitudes I < 27.5.\nPresent-day L* spirals would be undetected in the HDF above redshifts z ~ 1.2,\nand present-day ellipticals would disappear at z ~ 1.8. The Lyman break\nprovides a way to identify high-redshift galaxies at very faint magnitudes.\nHowever, galaxies that are at redshifts high enough to vanish from the HDF\nF300W or F450W filters also suffer severely from photometric biases. For\nexample, at fixed total apparent magnitude and physical scale length, a galaxy\nat z=4 will have a mean surface brightness 1.2 mag fainter than a galaxy at\nz=2.75. This lower surface brightness will result in an apparent decrease in\nthe number density of objects, and the inferred luminosity density, even for\nmodels where there is no intrinsic evolution.
