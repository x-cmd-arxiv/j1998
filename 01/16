This has the disadvantage that the strong correlation between radio\nluminosity and redshift within a single sample makes it impossible to be\ndetermine whether these differences are the result of cosmic evolution or\nwhether they are simply the result of source properties depending on radio\nluminosity. The solution to this problem is to compare the properties of\nsources in faint samples with those of the 3C sources. I and collaborators have\nrecently removed the degeneracy between redshift and radio luminosity by\ncomparing the 3C sample to the recently completed 6C and 7C samples. In this\npaper I concentrate on what our study has revealed about the host galaxies of\nradio sources. At low redshift, radio galaxies are giant ellipticals with\nabsolute magnitude being independent of radio luminosity over a range of $\\rm\n10^4$ in radio luminosity. At $z \\sim 1$, the radio-luminous 3C radio galaxies\nare still giant ellipticals, but the 6C galaxies, only a factor of six lower in\nradio luminosity, are fainter by about 1 mag in the near-IR and have much more\ncompact near-IR structures. At $z \\sim 1$, radio galaxies follow a line in a\ndiagram of optical luminosity verses de Vaucouleurs scale length parallel to\nthe projection of the fundamental plane for nearby ellipticals in this diagram.\nI discuss the significance of these results for our understanding of radio\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 1998 16:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this contribution I\nreview the use of UV spectroscopic diagnostics that can be `calibrated' at\nlow-redshift and then applied at high redshift. From the analysis of the UV\nproperties of local starbursts we have learned: 1) dust dramatically affects\nour view of high-mass star-formation 2) more metal-rich starbursts are redder\nand more heavily extincted in the UV, more luminous, have stronger vacuum- UV\nabsorption-lines, and occur in more massive and optically-brighter host\ngalaxies 3) the strong interstellar absorption-lines directly reflect the\nhydrodynamical consequences of the starburst. These results suggest that the\nhigh-redshift `Lyman Drop-Out' galaxies are are typically highly extincted by\ndust (average factor of 5 to 10), may have moderately high metallicities (0.1\nto 1 times solar?), are probably building galaxies with stellar\nsurface-mass-densities similar to present-day ellipticals, and may be suffering\nsubstantial losses of metal-enriched gas that can `pollute' the inter-galactic\nmedium. I also discuss UV observations of the nuclei of type 2 Seyfert\ngalaxies.

The absolute mass of a galaxy\ncluster can be measured by the gravitational lens magnification of a background\ngalaxy population by the cluster potential. The lensing signal is complicated\nby the variation in number counts due to galaxy clustering and shot-noise, and\nby additional uncertainties in relating magnification to mass in the strong\nlensing regime. Clustering and shot-noise can be dealt with using maximum\nlikelihood methods. Local approximations can then be used to estimate the mass\nfrom magnification. Alternatively if the lens is axially symmetric we show that\nthe amplification equation can be solved nonlocally for the surface mass\ndensity and the tangential shear. In this paper we present the first maps of\nthe total mass distribution in Abell 1689, measured from the deficit of lensed\nred galaxies behind the cluster. Although noisier, these reproduce the main\nfeatures of mass maps made using the shear distortion of background galaxies\nbut have the correct normalisation, finally breaking the ``sheet-mass''\ndegeneracy that has plagued lensing methods based on shear.

At order $p^2$ in the chiral expansion all three\nparameters of weak interaction can be determined. At order $p^4$ we are able to\nfix eleven additional constants out of thirteen contributing to off-shell\n$K\\to\\pi$ transitions, which leaves four undetermined constants in the on-shell\n$K\\to\\pi\\pi$ amplitudes. All ${\\cal O}(p^4)$ contributions have been exactly\nderived with $m_\\pi^2\\ne 0$.

The\ncircumstance is that though $L$ and $R$ measurements, being causally separated,\nare not invariantly time ordered, quantum-jump hypersurfaces associated with\nthe measurements are causelikewise ordered. Stapp's fifth proposition is true\niff $L$ hypersurface precedes $R$ one; but within the limits of special\nrelativity, it is impossible to determine the causelike order of those\nhypersurfaces. The entire Stapp's construct is revised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 1998 20:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Applied to QED in varying dielectrics the response theory approach\nfacilitates to study two distinct processes contributing to the production of\nphotons: the squeezing effect due to space-time varying properties of the\nmedium and of the velocity effect due to its motion. The generalization of this\napproach to finite temperatures as well as the relation to sonoluminescence is\nindicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 1998 13:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
