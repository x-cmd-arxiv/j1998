A literature\nsurvey including all experimental papers on fractals which appeared in the six\nPhysical Review journals (A-E and Letters) during the 1990's shows that\nexperimental reports of fractal behavior are typically based on a scaling range\n$\\Delta$ which spans only 0.5 - 2 decades. This range is limited by upper and\nlower cutoffs either because further data is not accessible or due to crossover\nbends. Focusing on spatial fractals, a classification is proposed into (a)\naggregation; (b) porous media; (c) surfaces and fronts; (d) fracture and (e)\ncritical phenomena. Most of these systems, [except for class (e)] involve\nprocesses far from thermal equilibrium. The fact that for self similar fractals\n[in contrast to the self affine fractals of class (c)] there are hardly any\nexceptions to the finding of $\\Delta \\le 2$ decades, raises the possibility\nthat the cutoffs are due to intrinsic properties of the measured systems rather\nthan the specific experimental conditions and apparatus. To examine the origin\nof the limited range we focus on a class of aggregation systems. In these\nsystems a molecular beam is deposited on a surface, giving rise to nucleation\nand growth of diffusion-limited-aggregation-like clusters. Scaling arguments\nare used to show that the required duration of the deposition experiment\nincreases exponentially with $\\Delta$. Furthermore, using realistic parameters\nfor surfaces such as Al(111) it is shown that these considerations limit the\nrange of fractal behavior to less than two decades in agreement with the\nexperimental findings. It is conjectured that related kinetic mechanisms that\nlimit the scaling range are common in other nonequilibrium processes which\ngenerate spatial fractals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 1998 02:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
