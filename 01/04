For this reason theoretical and\nobservational progress has been restricted in calculating one point\ndistribution functions and related moments. Methods based on factorial moments\nof two point count probability distribution (cumulant correlators) were\nrecently shown to be efficient in subtracting discreteness effects and\nextracting useful information from galaxy catalogs. We use these cumulant\ncorrelators $Q_{NM}$ to study clustering in scale free simulations both in two\nand three dimensions. Using this method in the highly nonlinear regime we were\nable to separate hierarchal amplitudes $Q_3, R_a and R_b$ associated with\ndifferent tree graphs contributing to third and fourth order correlation\nfunctions. They were found to increase with power on large scales. Results\nbased on factorial moments of one point cumulants show very good agreement with\nthat on cumulant correlators. Comparison of simulation results with\nperturbation theory and extended perturbation theory were found to be in\nreasonable agreement. Comparisons were also made against predictions from\nhierarchal models for higher order correlations. We argue that finite volume\ncorrections are very important for computation of cumulant correlators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jan 1998 22:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For this purpose we apply cross\ncorrelation (CC) analysis to a high resolution KECK spectrum of the galaxy. No\nsuch signature is found in the data. In order for cloud models to be compatible\nwith this result, there must be at least $\\sim3\\times10^7$ emitting clouds in\nthe BLR, where the limit is based on simulation of a homogeneous cloud\npopulation. More realistic distributions increase the lower limit to above\n$10^8$. These numbers are an order of magnitude improvement on our previous\nlimit from Mrk 335, where the improvement comes from higher S/N, broader lines,\nand refined simulations. Combined with the predicted upper limit for the number\nof emitting clouds in NGC 4151 ($10^6-10^7$), the derived lower limit puts a\nstrong constraint on the cloud scenario in the BLR of this object. Similar\nconstraints can be paled on models where the emission originates in streams and\nsheets. Thus, this investigation suggests that the BELs in NGC 4151, and by\nextension in all AGNs, are not made of an ensemble of discrete independent\nemitters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 1998 00:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Ideally\none would hope that a universal energy function exists, for which the native\nfolds of all proteins are the respective ground states.

We seek such\na set of parameters by perceptron learning, a procedure which is guaranteed to\nfind such a set if it exists.
