The X-ray spectrum of the source is very hard and is\nwell reproduced by a power-law component (Gamma = 1.5^+0.7_-0.6) with N_H =\n6^+4_-2 *10^22 cm^-2 (Sakano et al. 1998). We have found a galaxy with R=15.62\nmag near the center of the error circle for the X-ray source. The optical\nspectrum of the galaxy shows only narrow emission lines whose ratios correspond\nto those of a type 2 Seyfert galaxy at z = 0.072, implying an\nabsorption-corrected X-ray luminosity of 2*10^43 erg sec^-1 (2--10 keV) and M_B\n= -20.93 mag. A radio point source is also associated with the center of the\ngalaxy. We thus identify the X-ray source with this galaxy as an obscured AGN.\nThe hidden nature of the nucleus of the galaxy in the optical band is\nconsistent with the X-ray spectrum. These results support the idea that the\nobscured AGNs/QSOs contribute significantly to the cosmic X-ray background in\nthe hard band at the faint flux level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 1998 05:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

An accurate\nknowledge of these motions is a necessary prerequisite for such efforts. It is\nknown that harmonic vibrations of bond lengths and bond angles produce the\nhighest frequencies in proteins. There are also fast anharmonic motions, such\nas inter-atomic collisions, which are probably most important when bond lengths\nand bond angles are fixed. However, the specific time scales corresponding to\nall these limitations are not known precisely. In order to clarify the above\nissue this paper analyses time step limiting factors in a series of numerical\ntests by using an internal coordinate molecular dynamics approach, which allows\nchosen internal coordinates to be frozen. It is found that, in proteins, there\nis a rather complicated hierarchy of fast motions, with both harmonic and\nanharmonic effects mixed together at several close time scales. Non-bonded\ninteractions, notably strong hydrogen bonding, create locally distributed\nnormal modes with frequencies similar to those of bond stretching between\nnon-hydrogen atoms. They also impose ubiquitous anharmonic limitations starting\nfrom rather small step sizes. With fixed standard amino acid geometry,\nrotations of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups limit time steps at the 5 fsec\nlevel. The next important limitation occurs around 10 fsec and is created by\ncollisions between non-hydrogen atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 1998 16:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
