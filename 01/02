Each known construction provides the relevant Frobenius manifold\nwith an extra structure which can be thought of as a version of ``non-linear\ncohomology''. The comparison of thesestructures sheds some light on the general\nMirror Problem: establishing isomorphisms between Frobenius manifolds of\ndifferent classes. Another theme is the study of tensor products of Frobenius\nmanifolds, corresponding respectively to the K\\\"unneth formula in Quantum\nCohomology, direct sum of singularities in Saito's theory, and presumably, the\ntensor product of the differential Gerstenhaber-Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras. We\nextend the initial Gepner's construction of mirrors to the context of Frobenius\nmanifolds and formulate the relevant mathematical conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 1998 11:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As consequences we obtain that Lie algebra homomorphisms intergrate\nto Lie group homomorphisms, if the source group is simply connected and the\nimage group is regular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 1998 12:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
