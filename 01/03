The morphologies of\nboth nuclei are strongly affected by dust obscuration, even at 2.2 microns :\nthe primary nucleus (west) presents a crescent shape, concave to the south and\nthe secondary (eastern) nucleus is bifurcated by a dust lane with the southern\ncomponent being very reddened. In the western nucleus, the morphology of the\n2.2 micron emission is most likely the result of obscuration by an opaque disk\nembedded within the nuclear star cluster. The morphology of the central\nstarburst-cluster in the western nucleus is consistent with either a\ncircumnuclear ring of star formation or a spherical cluster with the bottom\nhalf obscured by the embedded dust disk.

It is shown that for a pure $s$ or pure $d$ wave pairing\nsymmetry, the electronic correlation suppresses the $s$ wave gap magnitude (as\nwell as the $T_c$) at a faster rate than that for the $d$ wave gap. On the\notherhand, a complex order parameter of the form ($s+id$) shows anomalous\ntemperature dependence. For example, if the temperature ($T_{c}^d$) at which\nthe $d$ wave component of the complex order parameter vanishes happens to be\nlarger than that for the $s$ wave component ($T_{c}^s$) then the growth of the\n$d$ wave component is arrested with the onset of the $s$ wave component of the\norder parameter. In this mixed phase however, we find that the suppression in\ndifferent components of the gap as well as the corresponding $T_c$ due to\ncoulomb correlation are very sensitive to the relative pairing strengths of $s$\nand $d$ channels as well as the underlying lattice. Interestingly enough, in\nsuch a scenario (for a case of $T_{c}^s > T_{c}^d$) the gap magnitude of the\n$d$ wave component increases with electron correlation but not $T_{c}^d$ for\ncertain values of electron correlation. However, this never happens in case of\nthe $s$ wave component. We also calculate the temperature dependence of the\nsuperconducting gap along both the high symmetry directions ($\\Gamma$ - M and\n$\\Gamma $ - X) in a mixed $s+id$ symmetry pairing state and the thermal\nvariation of the gap anisotropy ($\\frac{\\Delta_{\\Gamma - M}}{\\Delta_{\\Gamma -\nX}}$) with electron correlation.
