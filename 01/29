Previous analyses of this phenomenon have either\nignored radiation forces or assumed for simplicity that the radiation field is\nisotropic, and in particular that there is no variation of the radiation field\nwith angular distance from the rotational equatorial plane of the compact\nobject. However, in most realistic accretion geometries (e.g., those in which\nthe accretion proceeds via a geometrically thin disk) the radiation field\ndepends on latitude. Here we show that in this case radiation forces typically\nhave an important, even dominant, effect on the precession frequency of test\nparticles in orbits that are tilted with respect to the star's rotational\nequator. Indeed, we find that even for accretion luminosities only a few\npercent of the Eddington critical luminosity, the precession frequency near a\nneutron star can be changed by factors of up to $\\sim 10$. Radiation forces\nmust therefore be included in analyses of precession frequencies near compact\nobjects, in such varied contexts as low-frequency QPOs, warp modes of disks,\nand trapped oscillation modes. We discuss specifically the impact of radiation\nforces on models of low-frequency QPOs involving gravitomagnetic precession,\nand show that such models are rendered much less plausible by the effects of\nradiation forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 1998 20:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We suggest therefore that the distribution\nof damped Ly-alpha absorption line systems, of Ly-alpha emitting galaxies and\nof extremely red objects are all very strongly biassed, and that somehow a\nsmall overdensity of mass has increased the fraction of baryons in collapsed\nobjects, in the volume occupied by the cluster, to close to unity (a factor of\n~10 increase).\n  We speculate that some unknown physical process, acting on the volume\noccupied by our cluster, caused the normally diffuse ionised inter-galactic\nmedium to coalesce into small (< 10^8 Solar masses) blobs of neutral hydrogen,\nwhich produce the Ly-alpha absorption-lines. Star formation occurred within\nthese blobs at z>5, enriching them with metals and producing stars, which after\nseveral mergers and ~ 0.5 Gyr of passive evolution form the extremely red\nobjects.

Here\n'singular' stands for the fact, that the limiting geometrical structure differs\nfrom a regular Riemannian space-time. Geometrically, the transition Einstein to\nNewton can be viewed as an 'opening' of the light cones. This picture suggests\nthat there might be other singular limits of Einstein's theory: Let all light\ncones shrink and ultimately become part of a congruence of singular world\nlines. The limiting structure may be considered as a nullhypersurface embedded\nin a five-dimensional spacetime. While the velocity of light tends to zero\nhere, all other velocities tend to the velocity of light. Thus one may speak of\nan ultrarelativistic limit of General Relativity. The resulting theory is as\nsimple as Newton's gravitational theory, with the basic difference, that\nNewton's elliptic differential equation is replaced by essentially ordinary\ndifferential equations, with derivatives tangent to the generators of the\nsingular congruence. The Galilei group is replaced by the Carroll group\nintroduced by L\\'evy-Leblond.

These quantities are chosen because they are relatively\ninsensitive to theoretical uncertainties in the overall neutrino flux\nnormalisation and detection cross-sections and efficiencies. A $\\chi^2$\nanalysis using these quantities is performed yielding $3\\sigma$ ranges which\nare approximately given by $(0.725 - 1.0, 4 \\times 10^{-4} - 2 \\times 10^{-2}\neV^2)$ and $(0.74 - 1.0, 1 \\times 10^{-3} - 2 \\times 10^{-2} eV^2)$ for\n$(\\sin^2 2\\theta,\\Delta m^2)$ for the $\\nu_{\\mu} \\to \\nu_{\\tau}$ and $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_s$ solutions, respectively.
