Compared to earlier results obtained with this model for\nnearly central collisions of Si + Au at a laboratory bombarding momentum per\nnucleon of 14.6 GeV/c, the present results indicate that in Pb + Pb collisions\nthe freeze-out density is somewhat lower, the freeze-out temperature is\nslightly higher, the source at freeze-out is somewhat larger, and the\nlongitudinal collective velocity is very poorly determined (because of the\nlimited experimental coverage in rapidity). For both reactions, the freeze-out\ntemperature is less than 100 MeV and the longitudinal and transverse collective\nvelocities-which are anti-correlated with the temperature-are substantial.
