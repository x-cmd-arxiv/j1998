We prove that\nthe quantum octonion algebra satisfies the q-Principle of Local Triality and\nhas a nondegenerate bilinear form which satisfies a q-version of the\ncomposition property. By its construction, the quantum octonion algebra is a\nnonassociative algebra with a Yang-Baxter operator action coming from the\nR-matrix of $U_q$(D$_4$). The product in the quantum octonions is a\n$U_q$(D$_4$)-module homomorphism. Using that, we prove identities for the\nquantum octonions, and as a consequence, obtain at $q = 1$ new ``representation\ntheory'' proofs for very well-known identities satisfied by the octonions. In\nthe process of constructing the quantum octonions we introduce an algebra which\nis a q-analogue of the 8-dimensional para-Hurwitz algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 1998 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
