The model describes dynamics of ecological communities\non an evolutionary timescale. Species are defined as sets of characteristic\nfeatures, and these features are used to determine interaction scores between\nspecies. A simple rule is used to transfer resources from the external\nenvironment through the food web to each of the species, and to determine mean\npopulation sizes. A time step in the model represents a speciation event. A new\nspecies is added with features similar to those of one of the existing species\nand a new food web structure is then calculated. The new species may (i) add\nstably to the web, (ii) become extinct immediately because it is poorly\nadapted, or (iii) cause one or more other species to become extinct due to\ncompetition for resources. We measure various properties of the model webs and\ncompare these with data on real food webs. These properties include the\nproportions of basal, intermediate and top species, the number of links per\nspecies and the number of trophic levels. We also study the evolutionary\ndynamics of the model ecosystem by following the fluctuations in the total\nnumber of species in the web. Extinction avalanches occur when novel organisms\narise which are significantly better adapted than existing ones. We discuss\nthese results in relation to the observed extinction events in the fossil\nrecord, and to the theory of self-organized criticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 1998 18:07:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 1998 22:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The observations\nwere conducted using the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph on board the\nHubble Space Telescope. A very detailed abundance analysis via spectral\nsynthesis has been carried out for these two stars, as well as for two other\nmetal-poor objects with published spectra, using both Kurucz and OSMARCS model\nphotospheres, and taking into account consistently the NLTE effects on the line\nformation.

X-ray light curves and spectra from the ROSAT, Ginga, and ASCA\nobservatories show that the uneclipsed flux varies by as much as a factor of\ntwenty between a high-flux state when 0.71 second pulses are present and a\nlow-flux state when pulses are absent. In contrast, during eclipses when the\nX-rays consist of radiation scattered from circumsource matter, the fluxes and\nspectra in the high and low states are approximately the same. These\nobservations prove that the low state of SMC X-1 is not caused by a reduction\nin the intrinsic luminosity of the source, or a spectral redistribution\nthereof, but rather by a quasi-periodic blockage of the line of sight, most\nlikely by a precessing tilted accretion disk. In each of two observations in\nthe midst of low states a brief increase in the X-ray flux and reappearance of\n0.71 second pulses occurred near orbital phase 0.2.

Using the detection functor mentioned\nabove, this definition of topological Hochschild homology is shown to agree\nwith Bokstedt's original definition. In particular, this shows that Bokstedt's\ndefinition is correct even for non-connective non-convergent symmetric ring\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 1998 21:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By considering separately the one-particle\ndata and the correlation data, we find that the central baryon density, nuclear\ntemperature, transverse collective velocity, longitudinal collective velocity,\nand source velocity are determined primarily by one-particle multiplicity\ndistributions and that the transverse radius, longitudinal proper time, width\nin proper time, and pion incoherence fraction are determined primarily by\ntwo-particle correlations. By considering separately the pion data and the kaon\ndata, we find that although the pion freeze-out occurs somewhat later than the\nkaon freeze-out, the 99% confidence-level error bars associated with the two\nfreeze-outs overlap. These and other detailed studies confirm our earlier\nconclusion based on the simultaneous consideration of the pion and kaon\none-particle and correlation data that the freeze-out temperature is less than\n100 MeV and that both the longitudinal and transverse collective\nvelocities--which are anti-correlated with the temperature--are substantial. We\nalso discuss the flaws in several previous analyses that yielded a much higher\nfreeze-out temperature of approximately 140 MeV for both this reaction and\nother reactions involving heavier projectiles and/or higher bombarding\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 1998 00:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
