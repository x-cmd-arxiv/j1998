I\ngive details of the data collection and reduction procedure, and of the\nproduction of the HII region catalogue. For each HII region, the catalogue\ngives its position relative to the centre of the galaxy, its deprojected\ndistance to the centre, its radius, and its calibrated luminosity. I present\nthe results of a statistical study of properties of the HII regions. The\nluminosity function of the complete ensemble of HII regions is well fitted by a\npower-law slope in the higher luminosity range, confirming results for galaxies\nlike M100. Luminosity function slopes for arm and interarm HII regions\nseparately are equal within the errors of the fits, indicating that whereas the\ndensity wave accumulates material into the arm regions, and may trigger star\nformation there, it does not in fact change the mass distribution of the\nstar-forming clouds, nor the statistical properties of the HII region\npopulation. Diameter and radial number density distributions are discussed. The\nhuge number of HII regions allowed the construction of a number of independent\nluminosity functions at different distances to the nucleus. The slope of the\nluminosity function shows a marginal decrease with increasing distance from the\ncentre, which could indicate a gradual change toward shallower IMF slopes with\nincreasing galactocentric distance, or an evolutionary effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 1998 17:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Recently, the SRB measures\nwere found to be related to the nonequilibrium stationary state distribution\nfunctions for thermostated or open systems. Inspite of the importance of these\nSRB measures, it is difficult to handle them analytically because they are\noften singular functions. In this article, for three kinds of Baker-type maps,\nthe SRB measures are analytically constructed with the aid of a functional\nequation, which was proposed by de Rham in order to deal with a class of\nsingular functions. We first briefly review the properties of singular\nfunctions including those of de Rham. Then, the Baker-type maps are described,\none of which is non-conservative but time reversible, the second has a\nCantor-like invariant set, and the third is a model of a simple chemical\nreaction $R \\leftrightarrow I \\leftrightarrow P$. For the second example, the\ncases with and without escape are considered. For the last example, we consider\nthe reaction processes in a closed system and in an open system under a flux\nboundary condition.
