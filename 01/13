We derive a general, basis independent expression for the\nlattice operator, and show that its off-diagonal elements can be tailored to\ncouple the vibrational manifolds of separate magnetic sublevels. Using these\ncouplings one can evolve the state of a trapped atom in a quantum coherent\nfashion, and prepare pure quantum states by resolved-sideband Raman cooling. We\nexplore the use of atoms bound in optical lattices to study quantum tunneling\nand the generation of macroscopic superposition states in a double-well\npotential. Far-off-resonance optical potentials lend themselves particularly\nwell to reservoir engineering via well controlled fluctuations in the\npotential, making the atom/lattice system attractive for the study of\ndecoherence and the connection between classical and quantum physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 1998 01:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
