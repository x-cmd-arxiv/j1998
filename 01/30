We show that for $n$ greater than or equal\nto two, the number of independent parameters needed to specify an $n$-particle\ndensity matrix up to equivalence is $\\Pi_r d_r^2 - \\sum_r d_r^2 + n - 1$. For\n$n$ spin-${1\\over 2}$ particles we also show how to characterise generic\norbits, both by giving an explicit parametrisation of the orbits and by finding\na finite set of polynomial invariants which separate the orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 1998 15:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
