We have used photometric redshifts to select\ndifferent samples of galaxies in the HDF, in order to study their clustering\nproperties within the 2.5<z<4.5 domain, in redshift bins of 0.5, using\ndifferent techniques. A strong clustering signal is found for redshift bins\nincluding z~3.4 and leading to a present correlation length of r_0 = 4.1 +- 0.8\nh^-1 Mpc (q_0=0.1) assuming linear evolution. An excess appears in the\ncorrelation function of chip 2 with respect to the fit. This excess could be\nassociated to the main structure detected in this field, which contains 20% of\nthe objects identified at 3.4<z<3.9. Its dimensions are 3 h^-1 Mpc x 0.5 h^-1\nMpc. The galaxies at 3.4<z<3.9 exhibit a SFR of a few solar masses per year,\nbut their comoving density is a factor of ~50 higher than the population of\nstar-forming galaxies reported by Steidel et al. (1996b). The resulting star\nformation rate density is at least 1.1 10^-2 h Msun/yr/Mpc^3 (1.8 10^-2 h\nMsun/yr/Mpc^3) with q_0=0.1(0.5), slightly higher than the results by Madau et\nal. (1996) at 2.5<z<3.5, and then incompatible with a global decrease of the\nstar formation in this redshift domain. These results on star formation and\nclustering are consistent with a hierarchical scenario for galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 1998 17:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A broad Mg II emission line is detected in the total and polarized\nflux spectra of 3C 265 and 3C 277.2. The fractional polarization is high, and\nboth it and the position angle are constant with wavelength after accounting\nfor dilution by unpolarized starlight of the host galaxy, which can contribute\nsubstantially. An extended unpolarized continuum similar to that observed in\nother AGNs is also detected. Imaging polarimetry reveals a rough double-fan\nmorphology of the polarized light coincident with the extended aligned emission\nregions, with the position angle essentially perpendicular to the radial\nstructure of the extended UV/optical emission, and with the degree of\npolarization increasing with radius away from the nucleus. The radio jets lie\ninside the extended emission regions and, like every radius, are roughly\nperpendicular to the polarization PA. These results strengthen the view that\npowerful radio galaxies would be called quasars if viewed from a proper\ndirection. Based on the polarimetric data presented in this paper and in\nprevious studies, scattering of radiation from an obscured quasar source\nappears to be the preferred interpretation over jet-induced star formation for\nexplaining the alignment effect in HzRGs. Both electrons and dust can play a\nmajor role in the scattering process. However, the lack of strong direct\nevidence for either case, and our ignorance of the properties and distribution\nof the scatterers in these galaxies make it very difficult to discriminate\nbetween the two.

To illustrate this, we consider superstring theory compactified on\nan almost light-like circle. Specifically, we compute a one-loop four-point\namplitude in type II theory. As is well known, if the external states have\nvanishing momenta in the compact dimension, the divergence in the light-like\nlimit is even stronger than in field theory. However, in the case of present\ninterest, where these external momenta are non-vanishing, there is a subtle\ncompensation and the resulting amplitude has a well-defined and finite\nlight-like limit. The net effect of taking the light-like limit is to replace\nthe integration over one of the moduli of the 4-punctured torus by a sum over a\ndiscrete modulus taking values in a finite lattice on the torus. The same\nresult can also be obtained from a suitably \"Wick rotated\" amplitude computed\ndirectly with a compact light-like circle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 1998 19:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The associated first order systems and their formal\nasymptotic solutions have a rich Lie algebraic structure which was investigated\nby Drinfeld and Sokolov. We investigate the matrix Riemann-Hilbert\nfactorizations for these systems, and show that different factorizations lead\nrespectively to the potential, modified, and ordinary Gel'fand-Dikii flows. Lie\nalgebra decompositions (the Adler-Kostant-Symes method) are obtained for the\nmodified and potential flows. For $n>3$ the appropriate factorization for the\nGel'fand-Dikii flows is not a group factorization, as would be expected; yet a\nmodification of the dressing method still works.\n  A direct proof, based on a Fredholm determinant associated with the\nfactorization problem, is given that the potentials are meromorphic in $x$ and\nin the time variables. Potentials with Baker-Akhiezer functions include the\nmultisoliton and rational solutions, as well as potentials in the scattering\nclass with compactly supported scattering data. The latter are dense in the\nscattering class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 1998 23:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
