We confirm an almost linear scaling of the black hole\nmass with the baryonic mass of the host spheroidal galaxy. A remarkably tight\nrelationship is also found with both nuclear and total radio centimetric flux,\nwith a very steep dependence of the radio flux on M_{BH} (P\\propto\nM_{BH}^{2.5}). The high-frequency radio power is thus a very good tracer of a\nsuper-massive black hole, and a good estimator of its mass. This, together with\nthe lack of significant correlations with the low-energy X-ray and far-IR flux,\nsupports the view that advection-dominated accretion is ruling the energy\noutput in the low-accretion rate regime. Using the tight dependence of total\nradio power on M_{BH} and the rich statistics of radio emission of galaxies, we\nderive an estimate of the mass function of remnants in the nearby universe.\nThis is compared with current models of quasar and AGN activity and of the\norigin of the hard X-ray background (HXRB). As for the former, continuous\nlong-lived AGN activity is excluded by the present data with high significance,\nwhereas the assumption of a short-lived, possibly recurrent, activity pattern\ngives remarkable agreement. The presently estimated black hole mass function\nalso implies that the HXRB has been produced by a numerous population (\\sim\n10^{-2} Mpc^{-3}) of moderately massive (M_{BH}\\sim 10^7 M_\\odot) black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 1998 16:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Some of the uncertainties associated to the\nproperties of the underlying stellar models are throughfully discussed. First,\nwe present the effects that different formulations for the mass-loss rates\nproduce on the initial-final mass relation, and hence on the integrated\ncolours. Second, we describe the colour changes occurring at the onset of the\nAGB and RGB stars. The onset of the AGB is marked by a colour jump to the red,\nwhose amplitude is highly dependent on the metallicity and mass-loss rates\nadopted in the models. The overluminosity with respect to the standard Mc-L\nrelation, that occurs in the most massive AGB stars, causes a smoothing of this\ncolour jump. On the other hand, we find that a transient red phase takes place\n~1.5x10^8 yr after the RGB develops. We then discuss the possible reasons for\nthe transition of V-K colours (from ~1.5 to 3) that takes place in LMC clusters\nof SWB type IV. A revision of the ages attributed to the clusters reveals that\nthe transition may not be as fast as originally suggested. A gradual (or\ndelayed) transition of the colours, as predicted by models which include the\noverluminosity of the most massive AGB stars, describes better the data than\nthe sudden colour-jump predicted by classical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 1998 09:24:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 1998 13:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

All systems selected on the basis of 21 cm absorption and/or strong\nFeII lines relative to MgII ones turn out to have N(HI) larger than 10^20 cm-2.\nIt appears that although the scatter of metallicities is as large at z_a<1 as\nat high redshift, an increasing proportion of systems with metallicities ~ 30%\nsolar are found when going at lower redshifts. Our results suggest that\navailable observations may be biased against dust-rich absorbers. Further, when\nall available measurements of N(HI) and [Zn/H] are considered, a clear\ndeficiency of systems with large N(HI) and high metallicity is apparent.

As a\nconsequence, the high end of the HI column density distribution (and hence\nOmega_g, the contribution of neutral gas to the cosmological mass density) is\nprobably more heavily underestimated than previously thought, especially at low\nredshift.

In this picture\nthe r-matrix is related to a fourth rank tensor, named the r-tensor, on the\nconfiguration space. The r-matrix itself carries one connection type index and\nthree tensorial indices. Being defined on the configuration space it has no\nmomentum dependence but is dynamical in the sense of depending on the\nconfiguration variables. The tensorial nature of the r-matrix is used to derive\nits transformation properties. The resulting transformation formula turns out\nto be valid for a general r-matrix structure independently of the geometric\nframework. Moreover, the entire structure of the r-matrix equation follows\ndirectly from a simple covariant expression involving the Lax matrix and its\ncovariant derivative. Therefore it is argued that the geometric formulation\nproposed here helps to improve the understanding of general r-matrix\nstructures. It is also shown how the Jacobi identity gives rise to a\ngeneralized dynamical classical Yang-Baxter equation involving the Riemannian\ncurvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 1998 10:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
