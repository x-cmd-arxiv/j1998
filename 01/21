We study the color-magnitude (CM) relation as a\nfunction of radius in the cluster. The intrinsic scatter in the restframe B-V\nCM relation of the elliptical galaxies is very small: ~0.022 magnitudes. The CM\nrelation of the ellipticals does not depend significantly on the distance from\nthe cluster center. In contrast, the CM relation for the S0 galaxies does\ndepend on radius: the S0s in the core follow a CM relation similar to the\nellipticals, but at large radii (R>0.7Mpc) the S0s are systematically bluer and\nthe scatter in the CM relation approximately doubles to ~0.043 magnitudes. The\nblueing of the S0s is significant at the 95% confidence level. These results\nimply that the S0 galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster have formed stars\nmore recently than the S0s in the inner parts. A likely explanation is that\nclusters at z=0.33 continue to accrete galaxies and groups from the field and\nthat infall extinguishes star formation. The apparent homogeneity of the\nelliptical galaxy population implies that star formation in recently accreted\nellipticals was terminated well before accretion occurred. We have constructed\nmodels to explore the constraints that these observations place on the star\nformation history of cluster galaxies. We conclude that the population of S0s\nin clusters is likely to evolve as star forming galaxies are converted into\npassively evolving galaxies. Assuming a constant accretion rate after z=0.33,\nwe estimate ~15% of the present day early-type galaxy population in rich\nclusters was accreted between z=0.33 and z=0. The ellipticals (and the\nbrightest S0s) are probably a more stable population, at least since z=0.6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 1998 17:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In the Schwarzschild case, physical\nvariables are found which satisfy the Regge-Wheeler equation in both odd and\neven parity. In both cases, the unphysical \"gauge'' degrees of freedom are\nidentified with violations of the linearized Hamiltonian and momentum\nconstraints, and they are found to evolve among themselves as a closed\nsubsystem. If the constraints are violated, say by numerical\nfinite-differencing, this system describes the hyperbolic evolution of the\nconstraint violation.
