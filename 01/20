A deep (6 orbits), high resolution H-alpha+[NII]\nPC2 HST image shows a trailing, three arm spiral superposed on the underlying\nnuclear disk. Several of the extended filaments appear to connect directly to\nthe disk. The filaments extending to the NW appear to be twisted, as in NGC\n4258. Earlier arguments that the NW filaments are flowing from the nucleus are\nsupported by the presence of blue shifted non-Keplerian components within 20 pc\nof the nucleus. The gas in the blue and red shifted non-Keplerian components\nhas negative energy and will fall back into the nucleus. The morphological and\nkinematical observations can be explained by assuming that the filaments\noriginate in a bidirectional wind from the disk. Such a wind will carry away\nangular momentum, enabling gas in the disk to move toward the black hole.\n  Small (r ~ 1\"; r ~ 100-200 pc), well-defined dusty (D-type) and ionized\n(I-type) \"nuclear\" disks are common in elliptical galaxies. We suggest that the\nsize of the black hole's radius of influence R_BH relative to the radius of the\nnuclear disk R_disk determines whether the disk will be a D-type or I-type.\nI-type disks (M87 and M81) occur when R_BH > R_disk. Differential Keplerian\nrotation throughout the disk may then generate turbulence and shocks that\nionize the gas. D-type disks (NGC 4261 and NGC 6251) occur when R_BH << R_disk.\nThe regions of a disk that are exterior to R_BH will rotate at approximately\nconstant angular velocity in the galaxy's potential, shocks will be suppressed,\nand the gas will remain cold and dusty. Intermediate D/I types (3C264) may\noccur when R_BH is a significant fraction of the disk's radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 1998 16:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

I give detailed arguments,\nessentially based on the behaviour of quantum systems near the event horizon,\nwhich suggest that event horizon acts as a magnifying glass to probe Planck\nlength physics even in those contexts in which the spacetime curvature is\narbitrarily low. The quantum state describing a blackhole, in any microscopic\ndescription of spacetime, has to possess certain universal form of density of\nstates which can be ascertained from general considerations. Since a blackhole\ncan be formed from the collapse of any physical system with a low energy\nHamiltonian H, it is suggested that when such a system collapses to form a\nblackhole, it should be described by a modified Hamiltonian of the form\n$H^2_{\\rm mod} =A^2 \\ln (1+ H^2/A^2)$ where $A^2 \\propto E_P^2$.I also show\nthat it is possible to construct several physical systems which have the\nblackhole density of states and hence will be indistinguishable from a\nblackhole as far as thermodynamic interactions are concerned. In particular,\nblackholes can be thought of as one-particle excitations of a class of {\\it\nnonlocal} field theories with the thermodynamics of blackholes arising\nessentially from the asymptotic form of the dispersion relation satisfied by\nthese excitations.

For that purpose, use is\nmade of the preliminary E859 K^+ K^+ interferometry data from Si+Au collisions\nat 14.6 AGeV/c. As expected, less sensitivity is achieved in the present case,\nalthough it still is possible to distinguish two distinct decoupling\ngeometries. The present analysis seems to favor scenarios with no resonance\nformation at the AGS energy range, if the preliminary K^+ K^+ data are\nconfirmed. The possible compatibility of data with zero decoupling proper time\ninterval, conjectured by the 3-D experimental analysis, is also investigated\nand is ruled out when considering more realistic dynamical models with\nexpanding sources. These results, however, clearly evidence the important\ninfluence of the time emission interval on the source effective transverse\ndimensions.
