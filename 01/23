We consider a hypothetical situation of a portfolio\ncomposed of N uncorrelated stocks. Each stock price follows a multiplicative\nrandom walk with identical drift and dispersion. The rules of our model\nnaturally give rise to power law tails in the distribution of capital fractions\ninvested in different stocks. The exponent of this scale free distribution is\ncalculated in both discrete and continuous time formalism. It is demonstrated\nthat the dynamical redistribution strategy results in a larger typical growth\nrate of the capital than a static ``buy-and-hold'' strategy. In the large N\nlimit the typical growth rate is shown to asymptotically approach that of the\nexpectation value of the stock price. The finite dimensional variant of the\nmodel is shown to describe the partition function of directed polymers in\nrandom media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 1998 00:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 1998 20:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

We use Monte-Carlo renormalization\ntechniques for blocking the mean spin-spin interaction, <A>, and the mean gauge\nfield plaquette, <P>. The presence of the O(3) renormalized trajectory is\nverified and is consistent with the known three-loop beta-function. The\nfirst-order `vorticity' transition observed by Solomon et al. is confirmed, and\nthe location of the terminating critical point is established. New scaling\nflows in (<A>,<P>) are observed associated with a large exponent kappa in the\nrange 4~5. The scaling flows give rise to a strong cross-over effect between\nregions of high and low vorticity and are likely to induce an apparent signal\nfor scaling in the cross-over region which we propose explains the scaling\nobserved for RP(2), RP(3) and SO(4)-matrix models. The signal for this `pseudo'\nscaling will occur for the RP(2) spin model in the cross-over region which is\nthe region in which computer simulations are done. We find that the RP(2) spin\nmodel is in the same universality class as the O(3) spin model but that it is\nlikely to require a very large correlation length before the true scaling of\nthis class sets in. We conjecture that the scaling flows are due either to the\ninfluence of a nearby new renormalized trajectory or to the ghost of the\nKosterlitz-Thouless trajectory in the associated XY model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 1998 12:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 1998 12:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In these notes, we discuss at an elementary level\nthree themes concerning interface dynamics that play a role in pattern forming\nsystems: (i) We briefly review three examples of systems in which the normal\ngrowth velocity is proportional to the gradient of a bulk field which itself\nobeys a Laplace or diffusion type of equation (solidification, viscous fingers\nand streamers), and then discuss why the Mullins-Sekerka instability is common\nto all such gradient systems. (ii) Secondly, we discuss how underlying an\neffective interface description of systems with smooth fronts or transition\nzones, is the assumption that the relaxation time of the appropriate order\nparameter field(s) in the front region is much smaller than the time scale of\nthe evolution of interfacial patterns. Using standard arguments we illustrate\nthat this is generally so for fronts that separate two (meta)stable phases: in\nsuch cases, the relaxation is typically exponential, and the relaxation time in\nthe usual models goes to zero in the limit in which the front width vanishes.\n(iii) We finally summarize recent results that show that so-called ``pulled''\nor ``linear marginal stability'' fronts which propagate into unstable states\nhave a very slow universal power law relaxation. This slow relaxation makes the\nusual ``moving boundary'' or ``effective interface'' approximation for problems\nwith thin fronts, like streamers, impossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 1998 11:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
