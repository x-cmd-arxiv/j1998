With this in mind, we introduce a\nphenomenological model for a generalized dark matter (GDM) component and\ndiscuss its effect on large-scale structure and CMB anisotropies. Specifying\nthe gravitational influence of the otherwise non-interacting GDM requires not\nmerely a model for its equation of state but one for its full stress tensor.\n  From consideration of symmetries, conservation laws, and gauge invariance, we\nconstruct a simple but powerful 3 component parameterization of these stresses\nthat exposes the new phenomena produced by GDM. Limiting cases include: a\nparticle component (e.g. WIMPS, radiation or massive neutrinos), a cosmological\nconstant, and a scalar field component. Intermediate cases illustrate how the\nclustering properties of the dark matter can be specified independently of its\nequation of state. This freedom allows one to alter the amplitude and features\nin the matter power spectrum relative to those of the CMB anisotropies while\nleaving the background cosmology fixed. Conversely, observational constraints\non such properties can help determine the nature of the dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 1998 16:15:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 1998 17:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
