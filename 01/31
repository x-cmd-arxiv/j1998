During the propagation\nof the beam through the cloud, the process of excitation of plasma waves\nbecomes an important energy loss mechanism, especially for mildly relativistic\nproton beams. We compute the expected spectra of gamma-rays from the decay of\nneutral pions produced in hadronic collisions of the beam with the cloud,\ntaking into account collisionless losses of the electron-proton beam. This\nmodel may explain the X-ray and TeV gamma-ray (both low and high emission\nstates) of Mrk 421 as a result of synchrotron emission of secondary pairs from\nthe decay of charged pions and gamma-ray emission from the decay of neutral\npions for the plausible cloud parameters.

We show both that the\ninstability arises and that the cure we propose works in highly relativistic\nproblems such as tightly bound geodesics, spatially homogeneous spacetimes, and\nstrong gravitational waves.

This choice\nof modes is also consistent with zero production of these particles and thus\ncorresponds to a preferred vacuum state preserved by the evolution. In the\nzero-mass limit, we find that the quantum field equation implies the Einstein\nequation for the scale factor of a radiation-dominated universe; in the\nlarge-mass case, it implies the corresponding Einstein equation for a\nmatter-dominated universe. Conversely, if the classical radiation-dominated or\nmatter-dominated Einstein equations hold, there is no production of scalar\nparticles in the zero and large mass limits, respectively. The suppression of\nparticle production in the large mass limit is over and above the expected\nsuppression at large mass. Our results hold for a certain class of conformally\nultrastatic background geometries and therefore generalize previous results by\none of us for spatially flat Robertson-Walker background geometries. In these\ngeometries, we find that the temporal part of the graviton equations reduces to\nthe temporal equation for a massless minimally coupled scalar field, and\ntherefore the results for massless particle production hold also for gravitons.\nWithin the class of modes we study, we also find that the requirement of zero\nproduction of massless scalar particles is not consistent with a non-zero\ncosmological constant.

We start these lectures by introducing such\nnon-perturbative out of equilibrium methods in cosmological universes. We\ndiscuss the renormalization procedure and the choice of initial conditions. We\nthen study the nonlinear dynamics of quantum fields in matter and radiation\ndominated FRW and de Sitter universes. For a variety of initial conditions, we\ncompute the evolution of the inflaton,its quantum fluctuations and the equation\nof state. We investigate the explosive particle production due to spinodal\nunstabilities and parametric amplification in FRW and de Sitter universes with\nand without symmetry breaking.We find that the particle production is sensitive\nto the expansion of the universe.For symmetry breaking scenarios, we determine\ngeneric late time fields behavior for FRW and deSitter cosmologies.We find that\nquantum fluctuations damp in FRW as the square of the scale factor while the\norder parameter approaches a minimum of the potential at the same rate.We con-\nsider an O(N) inflaton model coupled self-consistently to gravity in the semi-\nclassical approximation for a `new inflation' scenario. We find that spinodal\ninstabilities drive the growth of non-perturbatively large quantum fluctuations\nwhich shut off inflation. These fluctuations assemble with the inflaton zero\nmode yielding a new effective field that actually rolls down behaving classi-\ncally. We compute the amplitude and index for scalar density and tensor\nperturbations. In all models of this type the spinodal instabilities produce a\n`red' spectrum of primordial scalar density perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 1998 16:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We report in this paper several\ninteresting shapes including a corniculate shape with six corns, a\nquadri-concave shape, a shape resembling sickle cells, and a shape resembling\nacanthocytes. As far as we know, these shapes have not been theoretically\nobtained by any curvature model before. In addition, the role of the\nspontaneous curvature in the formation of irregular crenated vesicles has been\nstudied. The results shows a positive spontaneous curvature may be a necessary\ncondition to keep an irregular crenated shape being mechanically stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 1998 01:50:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
