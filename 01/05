We reach the\nfollowing conclusion at present: (1) even in the Newtonian case, there exists\nthe ISCO for binary of sufficiently stiff equation of state (EOS). If the mass\nand the radius of each star are fixed, the angular velocity at the ISCO\n$\\Omega_{ISCO}$ is larger for softer EOS: (2) when we include the first PN\ncorrection, there appear roughly two kinds of effects. One is the effect to the\nself-gravity of each star of binary and the other is to the gravity acting\nbetween two stars. Due to the former one, each star of binary becomes compact\nand the tidal effect is less effective. As a result, $\\Omega_{ISCO}$ tends to\nbe increased. On the other hand, the latter one has the property to destabilize\nthe binary orbit, and $\\Omega_{ISCO}$ tends to be decreased. If we take into\naccount both effects, however, the former effect is stronger than the latter\none, and $\\Omega_{ISCO}$ becomes large with increase of the 1PN correction: (3)\nthe feature mentioned above is more remarkable for softer EOS if the mass and\nradius are fixed. This is because for softer EOS, each star has the larger\ncentral density and is susceptible to the GR correction: (4) there has been no\nself consistent calculation including all the 2PN effects and only exist\nstudies in which one merely includes the effect of the 2PN gravity acting\nbetween two stars. In this case, the effect has the property to destabilize the\nbinary orbit, so that $\\Omega_{ISCO}$ is always smaller than that for the\nNewtonian case.

Realistic\nuncertainties are generated for the theoretical predictions. These errors,\nmainly due to uncertainties associated with the elementary $K^+ +$ nucleon\namplitudes, are large, so that the disagreement that has been noted between\nexperimental and theoretical $\\sigma_{Tot}$ and $\\sigma_{Reac}$ is not\nsurprising. The results suggest that the $K^+ +$ nucleon amplitudes need to be\nmuch better determined before unconventional medium effects are invoked to\nexplain the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 1998 16:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
