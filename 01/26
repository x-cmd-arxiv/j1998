We follow the evolution of the wind using a very\nsimplified approach where a large number of layers interact by direct\ncollisions but where all pressure waves have been suppressed. We suppose that\nthe magnetic field and the electron Lorentz factor reach large equipartition\nvalues in the shocks. Synchrotron photons emitted by the relativistic electrons\nhave a typical energy in the gamma-ray range in the observer frame. Synthetic\nbursts are constructed as the sum of the contributions from all the internal\nelementary shocks and their temporal and spectral properties are compared to\nthe observations. We reproduce the diversity of burst profiles, the ``FRED''\nshape of individual pulses and the short time scale variability. Synthetic\nbursts also satisfy the duration-hardness relation and individual pulses are\nfound to be narrower at high energy, in agreement with the observations. These\nresults suggest that internal shocks in a relativistic wind may indeed be at\nthe origin of gamma-ray bursts.

Statistical distributions of quantum\nobservables determined from a finite number of experimental runs are\ncharacterized with the help of the generating function, which we derive using\nthe exact statistical description of raw experimental outcomes. We use the\ndeveloped formalism to point out that the statistical uncertainty results in\nsubstantial limitations of the determined information on the quantum state:\nthough a family of observables characterizing the quantum state can be safely\nevaluated from experimental data, its further use to obtain the expectation\nvalue of some operators generates exploding statistical errors. These issues\nare discussed using the example of phase-insensitive measurements of a single\nlight mode. We study reconstruction of the photon number distribution from\nphoton counting and random phase homodyne detection. We show that utilization\nof the reconstructed distribution to evaluate a simple well-behaved observable,\nnamely the parity operator, encounters difficulties due to accumulation of\nstatistical errors. As the parity operator yields the Wigner function at the\nphase space origin, this example also demonstrates that transformation between\nvarious experimentally determined representations of the quantum state is a\nquite delicate matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 1998 07:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 1998 20:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
