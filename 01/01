In this\npaper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn\napproximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very\nefficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is\nrepresented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the\nupper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and\nsimilarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which\nenables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when\nthe underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn\nformula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for\nmore complex updates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jan 1998 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nderived equations are solved by using a nonlinear perturbation method. The\ndependence of the interfacial profile on the triangular obstacle size, as well\nas its dependence on some flow parameters, such as the ratios of depths and\ndensities of the two fluids, have been studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jan 1998 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The\napproach is based on a recently proposed graded Poisson bracket on differential\nforms in field theory (see e.g. hep-th/9709229). A covariant analogue of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for a hypercomplex wave function on the space of field\nand space-time variables is put forward.
