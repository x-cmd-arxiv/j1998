In the present paper we generalize this formalism to include the case of\na closed system composed from two bodies of comparable masses, one of them\nhaving the spin S.\n  We employ the equations of motion given by Barker and O'Connell, where terms\nup to linear order in the spin (the spin-orbit interaction terms) are kept. To\nobtain the radiative losses up to terms linear in the spin, the equations of\nmotion are taken to the same order. Then the magnitude L of the angular\nmomentum L, the angle kappa subtended by S and L and the energy E are\nconserved. The analysis of the radial motion leads to a new parametrization of\nthe orbit.\n  From the instantaneous gravitational radiation losses computed by Kidder the\nleading terms and the spin-orbit terms are taken. Following Apostolatos,\nCutler, Sussman and Thorne, the evolution of the vectors S and L in the\nmomentary plane spanned by these vectors is separated from the evolution of the\nplane in space. The radiation-induced change in the spin is smaller than the\nleading-order spin terms in the momentary angular momentum loss. This enables\nus to compute the averaged losses in the constants of motion E, L and L_S=L cos\nkappa. In the latter, the radiative spin loss terms average to zero. An\nalternative description using the orbital elements a,e and kappa is given.\n  The finite mass effects contribute terms, comparable in magnitude, to the\nbasic, test-particle spin terms in the averaged losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 1998 18:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 1998 12:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
