Within that scheme we argue that the U(1)_A\nanomaly prevents Gell-Mann's choice for the realization of the su(4)_f (and\nthereby the su(3)_f) algebra for the particular case of the neutral axial\ncurrents. Rather, Weyl's choice for the SU(4)_f generators has to be used which\nleads to a neutral strong axial current having same structure (up to a constant\nfactor) as the weak one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 1998 12:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 1998 09:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A geometrical (coordinate-independent) formulation of the\nvariational principle is given. Its relation to Sedov's anholonomic variational\nprinciple for dissipative systems and to Poincar\\'e's variational principle in\nanholonomic reference frames is established. A modification of Noether's\ntheorem due to the torsion force is studied. A non-local action whose extrema\ncontain the autoparallels is proposed.
