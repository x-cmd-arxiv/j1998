Due to this fact, a study of the magnetic field decay may be a powerful\ndiagnostic of the properties of matter in the core where the density is above\nthe nuclear density. We treat the evolution of neutron stars for different\npossible equations of state and cooling scenarios (standard and, so called,\naccelerated cooling).\n  The spin evolution is strongly influenced by the behaviour of the magnetic\nfield. Assuming that the spin-down rate of the neutron star is determined by\nthe magnetodipole radiation, we calculated the evolutionary tracks of isolated\npulsars in the $B - \\tau$ and $B-P$ planes, where $B$ and $P$ are the magnetic\nfield and period, respectively, and $\\tau$ is the spin-down age. The calculated\ntracks are compared with observational data on the magnetic field and period of\npulsars.

The resummed corrections enable us to define, in the sense of\nfactorization, the underlying color exchange mechanism.
