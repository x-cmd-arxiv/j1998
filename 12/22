The SFR is affected\nby the ram-pressure from the intracluster medium (ICM). As the galaxy\napproaches the cluster center, the SFR increases to twice the initial value, at\nmost, in a cluster with high gas density and deep potential well, or with a\ncentral pressure of $\\sim 10^{-2} cm^{-3} keV$ because the ram-pressure\ncompresses the molecular gas of the galaxy. However, this increase does not\naffect the color of the galaxy significantly. Further into the central region\nof the cluster ($\\lesssim 1$ Mpc from the center), the SFR of the disk\ncomponent drops rapidly due to the effect of ram-pressure stripping. This makes\nthe color of the galaxy redder and makes the disk dark. These effects may\nexplain the observed color, morphology distribution and evolution of galaxies\nin high-redshift clusters. By contrast, in a cluster with low gas density and\nshallow potential well, or the central pressure of $\\sim 10^{-3} cm^{-3} keV$,\nthe SFR of a radially infalling galaxy changes less significantly, because\nneither ram-pressure compression nor stripping is effective.

In at least one and possibly both cases, the lens lies at, or\nclose to, the clouds themselves. On the face of it, this seems an improbable\noccurrence if the Galactic dark halo provides the bulk of the lensing\npopulation, as suggested by standard analyses of the MACHO dataset towards the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use a binomial statistic to assess the prior\nprobability of observing $M$ non-halo binary caustic events given a total\nsample of $N$ caustic binaries. We generalize for the case of multi-component\nGalactic and Magellanic Cloud models the Bayesian likelihood method for\ndetermining the lens mass and halo fraction from the observed timescales. We\nintroduce a new statistic, the ``outcome discriminator'', which measures the\nconsistency between the binary caustic data, prior expectation, and the MACHO\nLMC dataset as a whole. If the clouds are not embedded in their own dark halos\nof MACHOs, then the discovery of two non-halo caustic binary events out of two\n($M = N = 2$) is inconsistent with expectation given the MACHO dataset.\nGalactic models in which $M = 1$ is the likeliest outcome are also inconsistent\nwith the data, though models in which $M = 1$ has a reasonable prior\nprobability are not. We consider the possibilities that the Magellanic Clouds\nare embedded in dark haloes of their own, or that the Galactic halo is\nintrinsically deficient in the binary systems which produce caustic crossing\nevents.

In numerous astrophysical cases molecular cooling and heating\ninfluence dynamical evolution of the medium. The existence of a significant\nabundance of molecules can be crucial on the dynamical evolution of collapsing\nobjects. Because the cloud temperature increases with contraction, a cooling\nmechanism can be important for the structure formation, by lowering pressure\nopposing gravity, i.e. by allowing continued collapse of Jeans unstable\nprotoclouds. This is particularly true for the first generation of objects. It\nhas been suggested that a finite amount of molecules such as $H_2$, $HD$ and\n$LiH$ can be formed immediately after the recombination of cosmological\nhydrogen (Lepp and Shull 1984, Puy et al 1993). The cosmological fractional\nabundance $HD/H_2$ is small. Nevertheless, the presence of a non-zero permanent\nelectric dipole moment makes $HD$ a potentially more important coolant than\n$H_2$ at modest temperatures, although $HD$ is much less abundant than $H_2$.\nRecently Puy and Signore (1997) showed that during the early stages of\ngravitational collapse, for some collapsing masses, $HD$ molecules were the\nmain cooling agent when the collapsing protostructure had a temperature of\nabout 200 Kelvins. Thus, we analytically estimate the molecular cooling during\nthe collapse of protoclouds Then, the possibility of thermal instability during\nthe early phase of gravitational collapse is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 1998 14:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The relative strength of the exchange and\nelectron-phonon interactions determines whether the transition is first or\nsecond order. A giant drop in the number of current carriers during the\ntransition, which is a consequence of local bound pair (bipolaron) formation in\nthe paramagnetic phase, is extremely sensitive to an external magnetic field.\nBelow the critical temperature of the transition, $T_c$, the binding of the\npolarons into immobile pairs competes with the ferromagnetic exchange between\npolarons and the localized spins on Mn ions, which tends to align the polaron\nmoments and, therefore, breaks up those pairs. The number of carriers abruptly\nincreases below $T_c$ leading to a sudden drop in resistivity. We show that the\ncarrier density collapse describes the colossal magnetoresistance of doped\nmanganites close to the transition.\n  Below $T_c$, transport occurs by polaronic tunneling, whereas at high\ntemperatures the transport is by hopping processes.

In the case of\nthe sphere topology by using the Walkup's theorem we show that the dominating\nconfigurations are stacked spheres. These stacked spheres can be mapped into\ntree-like graphs (branched polymers). By using Baby-Universes arguments and an\nantsatz on the universality class between the stacked spheres and a model\ncoming from the theory of random surfaces we argument that this elongated phase\nis a trivial phase. The numerical evidence for a first order phase transition\nand the triviality of the elongated phase suggest that a new approach to\nsimplicial quantum gravity might be useful. Along this line following the work\nof various authors we study a first order version of Regge calculus formulated\nas a local theory of the Poincare` group. This first order formalism has the\neffects of smoothing out some pathological configurations, like \"spikes\", which\nprevent the theory from having a smooth continuum limit. These confingurations\nare in fact in the region of large deficit angles where the first order\nformalism and the secon order formalism are not equivalent on lattice.\n  We derive the first order field equations in the approximation of \"small\ndeficit angles\" and prove that (second order) Regge calculus is a solution.\nSuccessively we derive the general first order field equations by taking into\naccount the constraints of the theory. An invariant measure for the\npath-integral of this theory is defined. The coupling with matter, in\nparticular fermions, is also discussed in analogy to the continuum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 1998 11:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Using both equivalences we find that the bulk field has in\nfact two boundary fields, namely, the coupled boundary fields. Thus, from the\nviewpoint of the bulk-boundary correspondence the coupled fields are on an\nequal footing.

By far the\nlargest uncertainty emerges from the ambiguity in extending the many\non-shell-equivalent representations of the elementary amplitude off the mass\nshell. Indeed, relativistic impulse-approximation calculations that include the\nsame pionic distortions, the same nuclear-structure model, and two sets of\nelementary amplitudes that are identical on-shell, lead to variations in the\nmagnitude of the coherent cross section by up to factors of five.

In the discrete case, we extend previous results of ours showing that,\nagain by elimination of variables, the general projective system can be written\nas a mapping for a single variable.
