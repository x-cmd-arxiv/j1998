Extending the\npicture proposed by Dekel & Silk (1986), we argue that energetic supernovae\nwinds can expel baryons from all proto-galaxies with varying degrees of\nefficiency. The fraction of baryons retained and hence available to assemble\ninto the baryonic disk is therefore, a function of the central velocity\ndispersion of the halo. Such a coupling of the baryonic component to the dark\nhalo leads to the following interesting consequence, a prediction for a weak\nscaling of the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation or alternatively, the\nmass-to-light ratio with the central velocity dispersion of the halo. On\napplying to the case of the Milky Way halo, this feedback mechanism implies:\n(i) that the Milky Way halo lost approximately 10% of its original gas content;\n(ii) a range in the inferred redshift of formation $z_f$, and the local baryon\nfraction $f_b$ for the Milky Way that depends on the initial spin parameter of\nthe halo. We find that for a low spin halo - $z_f < 1$, $f_b \\sim 2%$; for a\nmedian spin halo - $z_f \\sim 1 - 2.5$, $f_b \\sim 5%$; and for a high spin halo\n- $z_f \\sim 4 - 8$, $f_b \\sim 20%$. The observationally determined ages for the\noldest disk stars in the Milky Way seem to rule out a low value for the spin\nparameter. Given the shape of the spin distribution of halos obtained in N-body\nsimulations, while a high value of the spin parameter is not very probable, it\nis interesting to note that if this is indeed the case for the Milky Way halo,\nthen feedback processes can cause the local baryon fraction to differ\nsignificantly from the universal value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 1998 04:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In NGC 2110, the emission\nline ratio [FeII]/Pa beta increases towards the nucleus (to ~ 7).

In Circinus,\nboth [FeII]/Pa beta and H2/Br gamma decrease from ~ 2 at 4 arcsec from the\nnucleus to nuclear values of ~ 0.6 and ~ 1, respectively, suggesting that the\nstarburst dominates the nuclear excitation, while the AGN dominates the\nexcitation further out (r > 2 arcsec). For both galaxies, the gaseous\nkinematics are consistent with circular rotation in the plane of the disk.

Based on the current analyzes\nof diffraction at HERA we find that the average strength of the interactions\nwhich govern diffraction in the gluon sector at $x \\le 10^{-3}, Q_0=2 GeV$ is\n~50 mb. This is 3 times larger than in the quark sector and suggests that\napplicability of DGLAP approximation requires significantly larger $Q_0$ in the\ngluon sector.

For A~200 the amount of\nthe gluon shadowing: $G_A/AG_N\\sim 0.25-0.4$ at $x<10^{-3},Q=2GeV$ is sensitive\nto the probability of the small size configurations within wave function of the\ngluon \"partonometer\" at the $Q_0$ scale.

To\ncontrol and monitor the large number of readout channels, we have built a\ndistributed control system based on Philips Semiconductors' I2C bus and\nmicrocontrollers. To date we have installed about 10800 channels of muon\nchambers and electronics. The average single channel noise occupancy is less\nthan 10**-5, and the detectors have been operated with target interaction rates\nas high as 70 MHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 1998 16:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
