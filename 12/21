It is found that, almost independent of initial\nconditions, a filamentary cloud continues to collapse nearly isothermally due\nto H_2 cooling until the cloud becomes optically thick against the H_2 lines.\nDuring the collapse the cloud structure separates into two parts, i.e., a\ndenser spindle and a diffuse envelope. The spindle contracts quasi-statically,\nand thus the line mass of the spindle keeps a characteristic value determined\nsolely by the temperature ($\\sim 800$ K). Applying a linear theory, we find\nthat the spindle is unstable against fragmentation during the collapse. The\nwavelength of the fastest growing perturbation lessens as the collapse\nproceeds. Consequently, successive fragmentation could occur. When the central\ndensity exceeds $n_c \\sim 10^{10-11} cm^{-3}$, the successive fragmentation may\ncease since the cloud becomes opaque against the H_2 lines and the collapse\ndecelerates appreciably.
