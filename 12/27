The shape of soft gamma-ray spectra of\nSeyferts observed by OSSE can be well modelled by thermal Comptonization. A\nvery strong correlation between the X-ray slope and the strength of Compton\nreflection in these sources can then be explained by thermal Comptonization in\nvicinity of the reflecting cold media. Similar correlation is seen for the hard\nstate of black-hole binaries, but the strength of Compton reflection at a given\nX-ray slope is larger than in Seyferts. This appears to be due to seed photons\n(for Comptonization) emitted by the cold media having larger energies in\nstellar-mass systems than in Seyferts. Broad-line radio galaxies have hard\nX-ray spectra with weak reflection, which reflection is similar to that in\nSeyferts with hard X-ray spectra. Two main models for the source geometry, a\nhot inner disk surrounded by a cold outer disk, and a dynamic corona above a\ncold disk, appear about equally viable based on the presently available data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 1998 14:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2000 09:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The components of electromagnetic field\nin this wave decay exponentially into both media. The characteristic decay\nlength is of the order of the Faraday rotation length for the propagation along\nthe gyration axis. The remarkable property of the boundary wave is its\nchirality. Namely, the wave can propagate only in one direction determined by\nthe relative sign of non-diagonal components of the dielectric tensor in\ncontacting media. We find the dispersion law of the boundary wave for the cases\nof abrupt and smooth boundaries. We also study the effect of asymmetry between\nthe contacting media on the boundary wave and generalize the result to the case\nof two parallel boundaries. Finally we consider the arrangement when the\nboundaries form a random network. We argue that at a point, when this network\npercolates, the corresponding boundary waves undergo quantum delocalization\ntransition, similar to the quantum Hall transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 1998 18:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
