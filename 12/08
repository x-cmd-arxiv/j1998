We propose the following scenario of the formation process of first\nluminous objects consisting of large number stars. First, by pancake collapse\nof the overdensity regions in the expanding universe or collision between\nclouds in potential wells, quasi-plane shocks form. If the shock-heated\ntemperature is higher than about $10^4$ K, the postshock gas cools down to\nseveral hundred K by \\Hbun line cooling, and the shock-compressed layer\nfragments into filamentary clouds. The filamentary cloud collapses dynamically\nonce more and fragments into cloud cores. Finally, a primordial star forms in a\ncloud core. We show that the minimum mass of the first star is essentially\ndetermined by the Chandrasekhar mass. Also, we investigate the dynamical\ncollapse of cloud cores by numerical simulation and show that the evolution\npaths of the central regions of the cores depend only very weakly on the total\ncore mass. After mass accretion, a massive star may be formed in a core, since\nthe estimated mass accretion rate is very large. In such a case, it may be\npossible for many massive stars form almost simultaneously. Then the clouds can\nbe luminous objects.

The first\nmodel involves coherent interlayer transport and makes use of results of\nsemi-classical or Bloch-Boltzmann transport theory. The second model involves\nweakly incoherent interlayer transport where the electron is scattered many\ntimes within a layer before tunneling into the next layer. The results are\nrelevant to the interpretation of experiments on angular-dependent\nmagnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO) in quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional\nmetals. We find that the dependence of the magnetoresistance on the direction\nof the magnetic field is identical for both models except when the field is\nalmost parallel to the layers. An important implication of this result is that\na three-dimensional Fermi surface is not necessary for the observation of the\nYamaji and Danner oscillations seen in quasi-two- and quasi-one-dimensional\nmetals, respectively. A universal expression is given for the dependence of the\nresistance at AMRO maxima and minima on the magnetic field and scattering time\n(and thus the temperature). We point out three distinctive features of coherent\ninterlayer transport: (i) a beat frequency in the magnetic oscillations of\nquasi-two-dimensional systems, (ii) a peak in the angular-dependent\nmagnetoresistance when the field is sufficiently large and parallel to the\nlayers, and (iii) a crossover from a linear to a quadratic field dependence for\nthe magnetoresistance when the field is parallel to the layers. Properties (i)\nand (ii) are compared with published experimental data for a range of\nquasi-two-dimensional organic metals and for Sr2RuO4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 1998 01:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 1999 11:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Though ultimately consonant with\nthe special and general theories of relativity, due to non-time-orthogonality,\nthe analysis predicts several peculiar (i.e., not traditionally relativistic)\nresults. For example, the local circumferential speed of light is not invariant\n(thereby agreeing with the Sagnac experiment), and no Lorentz contraction\nexists along the disk rim. Other experimental results, including time dilation,\nmass-energy dependence on speed, and what has heretofore been considered a\n\"spurious\" signal in the most accurate Michelson-Morley experiment performed to\ndate, are accurately predicted. Further, the widely accepted postulate for the\nequivalence of co-moving inertial and non-inertial rods, used liberally with\nprior rotating frame analyses, is shown to be invalid for non-time-orthogonal\nframes.

Hence there\nis no Peierls-Nabarro barrier impeding the propagation of kinks in this\ndiscrete system.

Even muonic and electronic neutrinos --it has been\nproposed-- might be \"tachyons\", since their square mass appears to be negative;\nnot to mention the apparent Superluminal expansions observed in the core of\nquasars and, recently, in the so-called galactic microquasars.

Rev. Lett.{\\bf 80}, 869 (1998)]. The other is based\non recognising that a two mode squeezed vacuum state is also entangled with\nrespect to photon number difference and phase sum. We show that this protocol\ncan also realise teleportation, however limitations can arise due to the fact\nthat the photon number spectrum is bounded from below by zero. Our examples\nshow that a given entanglement resource may admit more than a single\nteleportation protocol and the question then arises as to what is the optimum\nprotocol in the general case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 1998 04:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
