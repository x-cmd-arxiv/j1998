Of particular concern are systematic errors which vary slowly as a\nfunction of position on the sky, as these would induce spurious bulk flow. We\nhave compared the reddenings of Burstein & Heiles (BH) and those of Schlegel,\nFinkbeiner & Davis (SFD) to independent estimates of the reddening, for\nGalactic latitudes |b| > 10. Our primary source of Galactic reddening estimates\ncomes from comparing the difference between the observed B-V colors of\nearly-type galaxies, and the predicted B-V color determined from the B-V--Mg_2\nrelation. We have fitted a dipole to the residuals in order to look for\nlarge-scale systematic deviations. There is marginal evidence for a dipolar\nresidual in the comparison between the SFD maps and the observed early-type\ngalaxy reddenings. If this is due to an error in the SFD maps, then it can be\ncorrected with a small (13%) multiplicative dipole term. We argue, however,\nthat this difference is more likely to be due to a small (0.01 mag.) systematic\nerror in the measured B-V colors of the early-type galaxies. This\ninterpretation is supported by a smaller, independent data set (globular\ncluster and RR Lyrae stars), which yields a result inconsistent with the\nearly-type galaxy residual dipole. BH reddenings are found to have no\nsignificant systematic residuals, apart from the known problem in the region\n230 < l < 310, -20 < b < 20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 1998 19:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Contrary to the common belief that noncommutativity\nof space-time would be a key to remove the ultraviolet divergences, we show\nthat field theories on a noncommutative plane with the most natural\nHeisenberg-like commutation relations among coordinates or even on a\nnoncommutative quantum plane with $E_q(2)$-symmetry have ultraviolet\ndivergences, while the theory on a noncommutative cylinder is ultraviolet\nfinite. Thus, ultraviolet behaviour of a field theory on noncommutative spaces\nis sensitive to the topology of the space-time, namely to its compactness. We\npresent general arguments for the case of higher space-time dimensions and as\nwell discuss the symmetry transformations of physical states on noncommutative\nspace-times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 1998 14:41:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 1998 11:14:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 1999 15:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Predictions are made for cross sections into\nseveral channels and it is shown that the detection of the K^+ is sufficient to\ndetermine the shape and strength of the Lambda(1405) resonance. The\ndetermination of the resonance properties in nuclei requires instead the\ndetection of the resonance decay channels. Pauli blocking effects on the\nresonance, which have been shown to be very important for the resonance at rest\nin the nucleus, are irrelevant here where the resonance is produced with a\nlarge momentum. The nuclear modifications here would thus offer information on\nthe resonance and K^- nucleus dynamics complementary to the one offered so far\nby K^- atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 1998 17:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
