The sequence, which includes the\ncentral elliptical galaxy, has a slope in good agreement with the model\npredictions of Kodama et al (1998) for z~1. We estimate the integrated\nrest-frame luminosity of the cluster to be L_V > 3.2 x 10^{11}h^{-2}L_{\\sun}\n(after accounting for significant extinction at the low latitude of this\nfield), more than an order of magnitude higher than previous estimates. The\ncentral region of the cluster is deconvolved using the technique of Magain,\nCourbin & Sohy (1998), revealing a thick central arc coincident with an\nextended radio source. All the observed lensing features are readily explained\nby differential magnification of a radio loud AGN by a shallow elliptical\npotential. The QSO must lie just outside the diamond caustic, producing two\nimages, and the arc is a highly magnified image formed from a region close to\nthe center of the host galaxy, projecting inside the caustic.

The recent study of the\ncosmological perturbation during reheating shows that the adiabatic fluctuation\nbehaves like as the perfect fluid and no significant amplification occurs on\nsuper-horizon scales. In the oscillating inflation, however, the accelerated\nexpansion takes place during the oscillating stage and there might be a\npossibility that the parametric amplification on small scales affects the\nadiabatic long-wavelength perturbation. We analytically show that the density\nperturbation neglecting the metric perturbation can be amplified by the\nparametric resonance and the instability band becomes very broad during the\noscillating inflation. We examined this issue by solving the evolution equation\nfor perturbation numerically. We found that the parametric resonance is\nstrongly suppressed for the long wave modes comparable to the Hubble horizon.\nThe result indicates that the metric perturbation plays a crucial role for the\nevolution of scalar field perturbation. Therefore, in the single field case,\nthere would be no significant imprint of the oscillating inflation on the\nprimordial spectrum of the adiabatic perturbation. However, it could be\nexpected that the oscillating inflation in the multi-field system gives the\nenormous amplification on large scales, which may lead to the production of the\nprimordial black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 1998 02:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
