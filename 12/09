It is shown\nfor the first time that there exist three fundamentally different Auger\nrecombination mechanisms of (i) thresholdless, (ii) quasi-threshold, and (iii)\nthreshold types. The rate of the thresholdless Auger process depends on\ntemperature only slightly. The rate of the quasi-threshold Auger process\ndepends on temperature exponentially. However, its threshold energy essentially\nvaries with quantum well width and is close to zero for narrow quantum wells.\nIt is shown that the thresholdless and the quasi-threshold Auger processes\ndominate in narrow quantum wells, while the threshold and the quasi-threshold\nprocesses prevail in wide quantum wells. The limiting case of a\nthree-dimensional (3D)Auger process is reached for infinitely wide quantum\nwells. The critical quantum well width is found at which the quasi-threshold\nand threshold Auger processes merge into a single 3D Auger process. Also\nstudied is phonon-assisted Auger recombination in quantum wells. It is shown\nthat for narrow quantum wells the act of phonon emission becomes resonant,\nwhich in turn increases substantially the coefficient of phonon-assisted Auger\nrecombination. Conditions are found under which the direct Auger process\ndominates over the phonon-assisted Auger recombination at various temperatures\nand quantum well widths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 1998 19:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A coalescence model is proposed to\ndescribe the evolution dynamics of hadronic clusters produced in the nucleation\nprocess. The size distribution of the nucleated clusters is important for the\ndescription of the plasma conversion. The model is most sensitive to the\ninitial conditions of the QGP thermalization, time evolution of the energy\ndensity, and the interfacial energy of the plasma-hadronic matter interface.\nThe rapidly expanding QGP is first supercooled by about $\\Delta T = T - T_c =\n4-6 %$. Then it reheats again up to the critical temperature T_c. Finally it\nbreaks up into hadronic clusters and small droplets of plasma. This fast\ndynamics occurs within the first $5-10 fm/c$. The finite size effects and\nfluctuations near the critical temperature are studied. It is shown that a drop\nof longitudinally expanding QGP of the transverse radius below 4.5 fm can\ndisplay a long-lived metastability. However, both in the rapid and in the\ndelayed hadronization scenario, the bulk pion yield is emitted by sources as\nlarge as 3-4.5 fm. This may be detected experimentally both by a HBT\ninterferometry signal and by the analysis of the rapidity distributions of\nparticles in narrow p_T-intervals at small p_T on an event-by-event basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 1998 13:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
