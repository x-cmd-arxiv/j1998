We extend the stability analysis\nof Datye and Langer for a binary eutectic to include the effect of a ternary\nimpurity. We find that the expressions for the critical onset velocity and\nmorphological instability wavelength are analogous to those for the classic\nMullins-Sekerka instability of a monophase planar interface, albeit with an\neffective surface tension that depends on the geometry of the lamellar\ninterface and, non-trivially, on interlamellar diffusion. A qualitatively new\naspect of this instability is the occurence of oscillatory modes due to the\ninterplay between the destabilizing effect of the ternary impurity and the\ndynamical feedback of the local change in lamellar spacing on the front motion.\nIn a transient regime, these modes lead to the formation of large scale\noscillatory microstructures for which there is recent experimental evidence in\na transparent organic system. Moreover, it is shown that the eutectic front\ndynamics on a scale larger than the lamellar spacing can be formulated as an\neffective monophase interface free boundary problem with a modified\nGibbs-Thomson condition that is coupled to a slow evolution equation for the\nlamellar spacing. This formulation provides additional physical insights into\nthe nature of the instability and a simple means to calculate an approximate\nstability spectrum.

At a fixed field symmetry and\nconfiguration of its $N$ extrema situated at $p$-fold symmetry axis, physical\ncharacteristics of the spin depend periodically on $J$ with the period equal to\n$p$. The problem of the spectrum and eigenstates of the large spin $J$ is\nequivalent to analogous problem for a scalar charged particle confined to a\nsphere $S^2$ and placed into magnetic field of the monopole with the charge\n$J$. This analogy as well as strong difference between close values of $J$\nstems from the Berry's phase occurring in the problem. For energies close to\nthe extrema of the CEF, the problem can be formulated as Harper's equation on\nthe sphere. The $2J+1$-dimensional space of states is splitted into smaller\nmultiplets of classically degenerated states. These multiplets in turn are\nsplitted into submultiplets of states transforming according to specific\nirreducible representations of the symmetry group determined by $J$ and $p$. We\nclassify possible configurations and corresponding spectra. Experimental\nrealizations of large spins in a symmetric environment are proposed and\nphysical effects observable in these systems are analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 1998 02:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
