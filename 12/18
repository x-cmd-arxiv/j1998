The same\nresult also emerges in models with a horizontal $SU(3)_H$ symmetry. As a\nresult, at the tree level, these models lead to vanishing quark mixing angles.\nWe show that the correct mixing pattern can be generated in these models at the\nloop level from the flavor structure associated with the supersymmetry breaking\nterms. We generalize the constraints on supersymmetric parameters from flavor\nchanging neutral current (FCNC) processes to include several squark mass\ninsertions and confirm the consistency of the scheme. The expectations of this\nscheme for CP violating observables in the $B$ meson system are quiet different\nfrom the KM model, so it can be tested at the B factories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 1998 21:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Introducing an audience of general relativists to all the\nnecessary geometry related with extended supergravity (special geometry,\nsymplectic embeddings and the like) we describe the general properties of N=2\nblack holes, the structure of central charges in extended supergravity and the\ndescription of black hole entropy as an invariant of the U duality group. Then,\nafter explaining the concept and the use of solvable Lie algebras we present\nthe detailed construction of 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 supersymmetry preserving black\nholes in the context of N=8 supergravity. The Lectures are meant to be\nintroductory and self contained for non supersymmetry experts but at the same\ntime fully detailed and complete on the subject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 1998 23:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 1999 14:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One of the key ingredients of this model is the\npresence of new states neutral under $SU(3)_c\\otimes SU(2)_w$ but charged under\n$U(1)_Y$ whose mass scale is around that of the electroweak Higgs doublets. In\nthis paper we show that introduction of these states allows to gauge novel\nanomaly free discrete (as well as continuous) symmetries (similar to ``lepton''\nand ``baryon'' numbers) which suppress dangerous higher dimensional operators\nand stabilize proton. Moreover, we argue that these gauge symmetries are\nessential for successfully generating small neutrino masses via a recently\nproposed higher dimensional mechanism. Furthermore, the mass hierarchy between\nthe up and down quarks (e.g., $t$ vs. $b$) can be explained without appealing\nto large $\\tan\\beta$, and the $\\mu$-term for the electroweak Higgs doublets (as\nwell as for the new states) can be generated. We also discuss various\nphenomenological implications of our model which lead to predictions testable\nin the present or near future collider experiments. In particular, we point out\nthat signatures of scenarios with high vs. low unification (string) scale might\nbe rather different. This suggest a possibility that the collider experiments\nmay distinguish between these scenarios even without a direct production of\nheavy Kaluza-Klein or string states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 1998 06:45:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 1999 23:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We find that\nheavy resonances play an important role in the description of transverse flow\nabove 1 AGeV incident energy. For radial flow we analyse reaction times and\nequilibration and extract the parameters $T$ and $\\beta$ for temperature and\ncollective flow velocity within different prescriptions. Furthermore, we apply\na coalescence model for fragment production and check the mass dependence of\nthe flow signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 1998 10:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
