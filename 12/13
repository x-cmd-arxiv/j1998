The ROSAT HRI images reveal a point-like source\ncorresponding to NGC 4410a and an X-ray halo, extending 10\" from the nucleus\ntoward the southeast. The halo emission accounts for ~1/3 (L_X=1.3x10^{41} erg\ns^{-1} in the 0.1 - 2.4 keV ROSAT band) of the total X-ray emission detected\nfrom NGC 4410a. The spectrum of the total X-ray emission from NGC 4410a can be\nfitted at best with a two-component emission model, combining a Raymond-Smith\nspectrum with T = 10^7 K and a power-law spectrum (Gamma = 2.2). The fraction\nof the thermal component to the total flux within this model is 35%, supporting\nthe results of the HRI observation. The total unresolved X-ray luminosity\ndetected with the PSPC amounts to 4x10^{41} erg s^{-1} in the ROSAT PSPC band\n(for D = 97 Mpc). A preferable explanation might be the interaction between the\ntwo galaxies causing a circumnuclear starburst around the active nucleus in the\npeculiar late type Sab galaxy NGC 4410a. As a cumulative effect of exploding\nstars a superbubble forms a bipolar outflow from the galactic disk with an\nexpansion time of ~8 Myr. The central source injects mechanical energy at a\nconstant rate of a few times 10^{42} erg s^{-1} into the superbubble. A HST\nWFPC2 image decovers that NGC 4410a is seen almost face-on so that only the\napproaching outflow is visible. The HRI contours reveal an elongation of this\noutflow indicative for a faint X-ray ridge below the detection limit (L_X <=\n1.4x10^{39} erg s^{-1}) toward the neighbouring galaxy NGC 4410b caused by its\ntidal interaction. NGC 4410b houses only a faint X-ray source (L_X <=\n3.8x10{39} erg s^{-1}).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 1998 16:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
