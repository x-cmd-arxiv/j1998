The disk is in a hydrostatic equilibrium for all radii r > r_{in},\nwith the inner disk radius located between the marginally stable and marginally\nbound orbits: r_{ms} > r_{in} > r_{mb}. Matter flows from the disk through a\nnarrow cusp at r_{ms} and falls freely into the black hole, carrying with it no\nthermal energy. At radii larger than r_{out} the disk is assumed to radiate\naway all locally generated heat, and therefore the disk is geometrically thin\nfor r > r_{out}. We assume that no heat generated in the inner disk, with\nr_{out} > r > r_{in} can be radiated away, i.e. the disk is 100% advective, and\nit becomes geometrically thick in this range of radii. All enthalpy of the\nthick disk is used up to press the inner disk radius towards the marginally\nbound orbit, and to lower the efficiency of conversion of accreted mass into\nradiation generated only for r > r_{out}, by assumption.\n  Conservation laws of mass, angular momentum and energy make it possible to\ncalculate the inner thick disk radius r_{in} for any specified value of its\nouter radius r_{out}. As the nature of disk viscosity is not known there is\nsome freedom in choosing the shape of the thick disk, subject to several\ngeneral conditions, which include the hydrostatic equilibrium everywhere for r\n> r_{in}. The main purpose of this toy model is to emphasize the effect the\ndisk thickness has on lowering the energetic efficiency of a black hole\naccretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 1998 16:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 1999 21:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We draw attention to an apparent confusion in the literature between\nthe ortho-to-para ratio of molecules in FUV-pumped vibrationally excited\nstates, and the H2 ortho-to-para abundance ratio. These ratios are not the same\nbecause the process of FUV-pumping of fluorescent H2 emission in PDRs occurs\nvia optically thick absorption lines. Thus, gas with an equilibrium ratio of\northo- to para-H2 equal to 3 will yield FUV-pumped vibrationally excited\northo-to-para ratios smaller than 3, because the ortho-H2 pumping rates are\npreferentially reduced by optical depth effects. Indeed, if the ortho and para\npumping lines are on the ``square root'' part of the curve-of-growth, then the\nexpected ratio of ortho and para vibrational line strengths is the square root\nof 3, ~ 1.7, close to the typically observed value. Thus, contrary to what has\nsometimes been stated in the literature, most previous measurements of the\nratio of ortho- to para-H2 in vibrationally excited states are entirely\nconsistent with a total ortho-to-para ratio of 3, the equilibrium value for\ntemperatures greater than 200 K. We present an analysis and several detailed\nmodels which illustrate the relationship between the total ratios of ortho- to\npara-H2 and the vibrationally excited ortho-to-para ratios in PDRs.

The ejecta\nfrom this collapse has also been claimed as a source of r-process\nnucleosynthesis. So far, most AIC studies have focussed on determining the\nevent rates from binary evolution models and less attention has been directed\ntoward understanding the collapse itself. However, the collapse of a white\ndwarf into a neutron star is followed by the ejection of rare neutron-rich\nisotopes. The observed abundance of these chemical elements may set a more\nreliable limit on the rate at which AICs have taken place over the history of\nthe galaxy.\n  In this paper, we present a thorough study of the collapse of a massive white\ndwarf in 1- and 2-dimensions and determine the amount and composition of the\nejected material. We discuss the importance of the input physics (equation of\nstate, neutrino transport, rotation) in determining these quantities.

This z_c can be occur if a\nNeutron Star (NS) has a mass of ~2 M (solar) and radius ~8 Km, as is allowed by\nmost of the existing EOSs. Thus massive spherical stars can indeed collapse to\nsuch (more compact) NSs. We have shown that the efficiency for production of\nelectron-positron pairs out of the annihilation of resulting\nneutrino-antineutrino burst rises dramatically with the value of z_c and can\nsaturate to ~40%. This may explain a gamma ray burst of energy as high as ~5.\n10**53 erg. By using the already existing detailed (Newtonian) calculations, it\nfollows that the neutrino heating driven mass loss should be negligible, and\nthe bulk Lorentz factor of the initial fireball could be ~1000. Most of the\nexisting supernova calculations also show that it is extremely difficult to\nsimulate the direct neutrino driven mass loss, and, the shock is not launched\nif the gravitational field becomes stronger. Since the gravitation potential\nwell of the more compact NS is indded very deep, we do not expect additional\nbaryonic mass ejection. So, without invoking any exotic physics (like strange\nstars) or overstretching any theory, we may explain most of the luminous GRBs\nin this simple model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 1998 07:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 1998 06:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 1999 07:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, the large average distance of even the nearest\ncepheids measured by Hipparcos implies trigonometric parallaxes of at most a\nfew mas. Determining unbiased distances and absolute magnitudes from such high\nrelative error parallax data is not a trivial problem.In 1997, Feast &\nCatchpole announced that Hipparcos cepheid parallaxes indicated a\nPeriod-Luminosity scale 0.2 mag brighter than previous calibrations, with\nimportant consequences on the whole cosmic distance scale. In the wake of this\ninitial study, several authors have reconsidered the question, and favour\nfainter calibrations of cepheid luminositites, compatible with pre-Hipparcos\nvalues. All authors used equivalent data sets, and the bulk of the difference\nin the results arises from the statistical treatment of the parallax data. We\nhave attempted to repeat the analyses of all these studies and test them with\nMonte Carlo simulations and synthetic samples.

We will show\nthat such models still suffer from the other drawback of D-inflationary models,\nnamely that Planckian field values are required to drive inflation. Thus it is\nhard to understand why the inflaton potential remains so flat without imposing\nstringent symmetries on the superpotential. We also examine a fascinating\nquasi-fixed point behavior for the gauge coupling of the anomalous U(1) in\nthese extra-dimensional models, and show that either the presence of large\nnumbers of fields in the 5-dimensional bulk or strongly suppressed U(1) gauge\ncouplings is required in order to restore naturality to the inflationary\npotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 1998 22:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To derive the new\nrepresentation, the gauge invariance of the model is exploited. The role of the\ngauge boson masses in gauge-invariant models of the strong interactions based\non the $\\sigma$ model is also discussed, and it is shown that these masses are\nnecessary if the pion is to survive as a physical field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 1998 17:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The\nfirst case deals with formulating nuclear physics of {\\it dilute} nuclear\nsystems with a focus on both bound and scattering processes in two-nucleon\nsystems in terms of effective field theories (EFT), e.g., in the framework of\nchiral perturbation theory. The second case requires formulating effective\nfield theories for {\\it dense} hadronic matter such as heavy nuclei and nuclear\nmatter under normal as well as extreme conditions expected to be encountered in\ncompact stars and in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energy.
