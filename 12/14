A collection of K' measurements of core-collapse SNe near maximum\nlight is presented. Results of a preliminary SN search using the MIRC camera at\nthe Wyoming IR Observatory (WIRO), and an improved search using the ORCA optics\nare described.

We derive the\nEffective Lagrangian from the QCD one, and show that in the limit of heavy mass\nM for the initial hadron and large energy E for the final one, the heavy and\nlight quark fields behave as two-component spinors. Neglecting QCD\nshort-distance corrections, this implies that there are only three form factors\ndescribing all the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar or vector weak current matrix\nelements. We argue that the dependence of these form factors with respect to M\nand E should be factorizable, the M-dependence (sqrt(M)) being derived from the\nusual heavy quark expansion while the E-dependence is controlled by the\nbehaviour of the light-cone distribution amplitude near the end-point u=1. The\nusual expectation of the (1-u) behaviour leads to a 1/E^2 scaling law, that is\na dipole form in q^2. We also show explicitly that in the appropriate limit,\nthe Light-Cone Sum Rule method satisfies our general relations as well as the\nscaling laws in M and E of the form factors, and obtain very compact and simple\nexpressions for the latter.
