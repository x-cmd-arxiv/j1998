Two crossing separatrices lead to four\ngeneric types of motion.

Is this\nconnection really useful? The answer to these questions leads to a new and\nunifying approach to the theory of random matrices. Introducing an appropriate\ntime t-dependence in the probability distribution of the matrix ensemble, leads\nto vertex operator expressions for the n-point correlation functions\n(probabilities of n eigenvalues in infinitesimal intervals) and the\ncorresponding Fredholm determinants (probabilities of no eigenvalue in a Borel\nsubset E); the latter probability is a ratio of tau-functions for the\nKP-equation, whose numerator satisfy partial differential equations, which\ndecouple into the sum of two parts: a Virasoro-like part depending on time only\nand a Vect(S^1)-part depending on the boundary points A_i of E. Upon setting\nt=0, and using the KP-hierarchy to eliminate t-derivatives, these PDE's lead to\na hierarchy of non-linear PDE's, purely in terms of the A_i. These PDE's are\nnothing else but the KP hierarchy for which the t-partials, viewed as commuting\noperators, are replaced by non-commuting operators in the endpoints A_i of the\nE under consideration. When the boundary of E consists of one point and for the\nknown kernels, one recovers the Painleve equations, found in prior work on the\nsubject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 1998 17:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
