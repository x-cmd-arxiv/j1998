The isochrones have been simultaneously fit to BV and VI\ncolor magnitude diagrams, with the same composition, reddening and distance\nmodulus required for both colors. Our best fitting isochrone assumes [Fe/H] =\n+0.4, scaled solar abundance ratios, and dY/dZ = 2 (Y = 0.31), yielding an\nexcellent fit to the data at all points along the major sequences. The\nresulting age is 8 Gyr, with E(B-V) = 0.10 and (m-M)_v = 13.42. The derived\ncluster parameters are fairly robust to variations in the isochrone [Fe/H] and\nhelium abundances. All of the acceptable fits indicate that 0.07 < E(B-V) <\n0.14$, 13.29 < (m-M)_v < 13.46, and that NGC 6791 has an age of 8.0+/- 0.5 Gyr.\nThe fits also suggest that dY/dZ lies between 1 and 3. A metallicity as low as\nsolar is clearly ruled out, as is dY/dZ = 0. Comparison with previous isochrone\nstudies indicates that the derived reddening is primarily due to our use of the\nmost recent color transformations, whereas the age depends upon both the colors\nand the input physics. Our isochrones provide an excellent fit to the Hyades\nzero-age main sequence as determined by Hipparcos, providing evidence that our\nderived reddening and distance modulus are reliable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 1998 16:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

They are responsible for the masses of all light flavour\nhadrons. However, the composition of these scalar states is far from clear,\ndespite decades of experimental effort. The two photon couplings of the\n$f_{0}$'s are a guide to their structure. Two photon results from Mark II,\nCrystal Ball and CELLO prompt a new Amplitude Analysis of\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $\\pi^0\\pi^0$ cross-sections. Despite their\ncurrently limited angular coverage and lack of polarized photons, we use a\nmethodology that provides the nearest one can presently achieve to a\nmodel-independent partial wave separation. We find two distinct classes of\nsolutions. Both have very similar two photon couplings for the $f_0(980)$ and\n$f_0(400-1200)$. Hopefully these definitive results will be a spur to dynamical\ncalculations that will bring us a better understanding of these important\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 1998 06:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We show how semi-classical properties of the\nstring theory reproduce many features of the AdS/CFT duality. Furthermore, we\nexamine how the Virasoro symmetry of Brown and Henneaux is realized in string\ntheory, and show how it leads to the Virasoro Ward identities of the boundary\nCFT. The Virasoro generators of GKS emerge naturally in this analysis. Our work\nclarifies several aspects of the GKS construction: why the Brown-Henneaux\nVirasoro algebra can be realized on the first-quantized Hilbert space, to what\nextent the free-field approximation is valid, and why the Virasoro generators\nact on the string worldsheet localized near the boundary of AdS_3.
