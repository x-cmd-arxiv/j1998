This picture is relevant to a variety of systems, ranging from atomic\nnuclei to microwave cavities; the main application here is to electronic\ntransport through ballistic microstructures. The theory describes the regime in\nwhich there are two distinct time scales, associated with a prompt and an\nequilibrated response, and is cast in terms of the matrix of scattering\namplitudes S. The prompt response is related to the energy average of S which,\nthrough ergodicity, is expressed as the average over an ensemble of systems. We\nuse an information-theoretic approach: the ensemble of S-matrices is determined\nby (1) general physical features-- symmetry, causality, and ergodicity, (2) the\nspecific energy average of S, and (3) the notion of minimum information in the\nensemble. This ensemble, known as Poisson's kernel, is meant to describe those\nsituations in which any other information is irrelevant. Thus, one constructs\nthe one-energy statistical distribution of S using only information expressible\nin terms of S itself without ever invoking the underlying Hamiltonian. This\nformulation has a remarkable predictive power: from the distribution of S we\nderive properties of the quantum conductance of cavities, including its\naverage, its fluctuations, and its full distribution in certain cases, both in\nthe absence and presence prompt response.

In the mean-field limit the model is well\ndescribed by the Adam-Gibbs-DiMarzio scenario for the glass transition; however\nin the short-range case this picture turns out to be modified. The model\npresents a finite temperature continuous phase transition characterized by a\ndivergent spin-glass susceptibility and a negative specific heat exponent.

We study the vibrational behavior\nof one class of MEMS devices: micron-scale resonators made of silicon and\nquartz. The algorithmic and computational avenue applied here represents a\nsignificant departure from the usual finite element approach based on continuum\nelastic theory. The approach is to use an atomistic simulation in regions of\nsignificantly anharmonic forces and large surface area to volume ratios or\nwhere internal friction due to defects is anticipated. Peripheral regions of\nMEMS which are well-described by continuum elastic theory are simulated using\nfinite elements for efficiency. Thus, in central regions of the device, the\nmotion of millions of individual atoms is simulated, while the relatively large\nperipheral regions are modeled with finite elements. The two techniques run\nconcurrently and mesh seamlessly, passing information back and forth. This\ncoupling of length scales gives a natural domain decomposition, so that the\ncode runs on multiprocessor workstations and supercomputers. We present novel\nsimulations of the vibrational behavior of micron-scale silicon and quartz\noscillators.
