The spectral energy distributions are double peaked\nand follow a self-similar sequence in luminosity, which can be explained by\nelectron cooling on ambient photons.

A total integration time of\n23,280 s was obtained. The spectrum clearly delineates the Gunn-Peterson HeII\nabsorption trough, produced by HeII Lya, along the line of sight over the\nredshift range z=2.78-3.28. Its interpretation was facilitated by modeling\nbased on Keck HIRES spectra of the HI Lya forest (provided by A. Songaila and\nby M. Rauch and W. Sargent). We find that near the quasar HeII Lya absorption\nis produced by discrete clouds, with no significant diffuse gas; this is\nattributed to a HeII \"proximity effect\" in which the quasar fully ionizes He in\nthe diffuse intergalactic medium, but not the He in denser clouds. By two\ndifferent methods we calculate that the average HeII Lya opacity at z~3.15 is\ntau >= 4.8. In the Dobrzycki-Bechtold void in the HI Lya forest near z=3.18,\nthe average HeII opacity tau=4.47^{+0.48}_{-0.33}.

We have found the equivalent variability in our data,\nwhich, as also seen in UV data, is mostly confined to the emission lines. The\nHeII 4686 changes by the largest amount, consistent with X-ray driven\nphoto-ionisation.

We explicitly construct the specific optimal and minimal\ngeneralized measurements, which turn out to be independent of the a priori\nprobability distribution, obtaining the best guesses for the unknown state as\nwell as a closed expression for the maximal mean averaged fidelity. We do this\nfor up to three copies of the unknown state in a way which leads to the\ngeneralization to any number of copies, which we then present and prove.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 1998 10:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 1998 09:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
