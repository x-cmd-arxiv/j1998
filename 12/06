The hypothesis suggests a baryon poor jet (BPJ) existing within a\nbaryon rich outflow. The sharp distinction can be attributed to whether or not\nthe magnetic field lines thread an event horizon. Such a configuration suggests\nthat there will be some non-thermal acceleration of pick-up ex-neutrons within\nthe BPJ.
