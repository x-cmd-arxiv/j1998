In\nthis paper we examine extinction power spectra in some detail, using\nfamily-level data from a variety of different sources. We find that although\nthe average form of the power spectrum roughly obeys the 1/f law, the spectrum\ncan be represented more accurately by dividing it into two regimes: a\nlow-frequency one which is well fit by an exponential, and a high-frequency one\nin which it follows a power law with a 1/f^2 form.

For a perfect fluid negative presure leads to\ninstabilities that are most severe on the shortest scales. However, if instead\nthe dark matter is a solid, with an elastic resistance to pure shear\ndeformations, an equation of state with negative presure can avoid these short\nwavelength instabilities.

Two possible candidates for a solid dark matter\ncomponent are a frustrated network of non-Abelian cosmic strings or a\nfrustrated network of domain walls.

Some aspects of\nthis problem are reexamined here. The primary technical novelty is that the\ntetrad generally relativistic method of Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko for\ndescribing a spinor particle is exploited. The choice of the formalism has\nturned out to be of great fruitfulness for examining the system. It is matter\nthat, as known, the use of a special spherical tetrad in the theory of a spin\n1/2 particle had led Schrodinger to a basis of remarkable features. The basis\nhas been used with great efficiency by Pauli in his investigation on the pro-\nblem of allowed spherically symmetric wave functions in quantum mechanics. For\nour purposes, just several simple rules extracted from the much more com-\nprehensive Pauli's analysis will be quite sufficient; those are almost mnemo-\nnic working regulations. So, one may remember some very primary facts of D-\nfunctions theory and then produce automatically proper wave functions. It seems\nrather likely, that there may exist a generalized analog of such a re-\npresentation for J(i)-operators, that might be successfully used whenever in a\nlinear problem there exists a spherical symmetry, irrespective of the con-\ncrete embodiment of such a symmetry. In particular, the case of electron in the\nexternal Abelian monopole field completely come under the Sch-Pau method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 1998 16:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

On that way a general- ly\nrelativistical Duffin-Kemmer equation is costructed. So, the manner of\nextending the flat space Dirac equation to general relativity case indicates\nclearly that the Lorentz group underlies equally both these theories. In other\nwords, the Lorentz group retains its importance and significance at changing\nthe Minkowski space model to an arbitrary curved space-time. In contrast to\nthis, at generalizing the Proca formulation, we automatically destroy any\nrelations to the Lorentz group, although the definition itself for a spin 1\nparticle as an elementary object was based on just this group.
