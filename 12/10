The\ngas dynamics of the oval are found to be consistent with those of a\nkinematically weak bar, fully confirming previous suggestions for the presence\nof a fat bar, and, for the first time, individual gaseous features in the bar\nare spatially resolved. In particular, the two bright regions close to the\nleading edges of the bar in NGC4151 exhibit kinematics strikingly similar to\nthe signature of bar shocks seen in gas-dynamical simulations, and demonstrate\nhow strong the gaseous response may be even in such a weak bar potential. The\nresidual velocity field, showing deviations from circular motion, is largely\nconsistent with streaming in a bar potential, and, in addition, clearly shows\nthat inflow is concentrated in narrow regions originating in the shocks. This\ninflow may represent an early stage in the fuelling process of the AGN.\n  The presence and properties of the shocks in NGC4151 indicate that, in\naddition to the x_1 orbits, the family of x_2 orbits exist and are of\nsignificant extent in the bar of NGC4151, with gas streaming from the shocks\nmaking the transition between the two families. We therefore suggest that the\ncircumnuclear ellipse, identified optically by previous authors and associated\nwith gas flowing in x_2 orbits, has formed as a natural consequence of the gas\nflows in the bar without the requirement for a second, inner bar.\n  Observations of HI were previously thought to be ill-suited to the study of\nbar shocks due to limitations in angular resolution and sensitivity. However,\nour observations show that, following recent instrumental enhancements, such\nmeasurements are now feasible, albeit at the limits of instrumental capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 1998 16:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The coherence function between soft and hard photon variability\nshows that if these are truly independent processes, then they are individually\ncoherent, but they are incoherent with one another. This is evidenced by the\nfact that the coherence function between the hard and soft variability is near\nunity between 0.005-10 Hz but shows evidence of a dip at f approximately equal\nto 1 Hz. This is the region of overlap between the broad Lorentzian fits to the\nPSD. Similar to Cyg X-1, the coherence also drops dramatically at frequencies\napproximately greater than 10 Hz. Also similar to Cyg X-1, the hard photon\nvariability is seen to lag the soft photon variability with the lag time\nincreasing with decreasing Fourier frequency.

This is a nonperturbative process which\noccurs almost instantly; no oscillations or parametric resonance is required.\nThe effective masses of the $\\chi$ particles may be very small at the moment\nwhen they are produced, but they ``fatten'' when the field $\\phi$ increases.\nWhen the particles $\\chi$ become sufficiently heavy, they rapidly decay to\nother, lighter particles. This leads to an almost instantaneous reheating\naccompanied by the production of particles with masses which may be as large as\n$10^{17}-10^{18}$ GeV. This mechanism works in the usual inflationary models\nwhere $V(\\phi)$ has a minimum, where it takes only a half of a single\noscillation of the inflaton field $\\phi$, but it is especially efficient in\nmodels with effective potentials slowly decreasing at large $\\phi$ as in the\ntheory of quintessence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 1998 21:50:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 1998 22:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

This paper discusses some properties of these Picard-Fuchs\nODEs. In contrast with the usual Picard-Fuchs systems written in terms of\nmoduli derivatives, there exists a Wronskian for this ordinary differential\nsystem and this Wronskian produces a new relation among periods, moduli and QCD\nscale parameter, which in the case of SU(2) is reminiscent of scaling relation\nof prepotential.

In fact, continuous PVI emerges as\nthe equation obeyed by the solutions of the discrete equation in terms of the\nlattice parameters rather than the lattice variables that label the lattice\nsites. We show that the bilinear form of PVI is embedded naturally in the\nlattice systems leading to the GDP. Further results include the establishment\nof Baecklund and Schlesinger transformations for the GDP, the corresponding\nisomonodromic deformation problem, and the self-duality of its bilinear scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 1998 15:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
