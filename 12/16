We present an analysis of the\nionization state, chemical abundances, and kinematic characteristics of two\nmetal-line systems at z=1.92 and z=1.94 toward J2233-606. We focus on these two\nsystems because (i) the observations provide full coverage of the Lyman series,\nhence an accurate determination of their HI column densities and (ii) the\nmetal-line transitions allow a measurement of their ionization state.\n  Line-profile fits of the Lyman series for the two systems indicate log N(HI)\n= 17.15 \\pm 0.02 cm^-2 evenly distributed between two components for the z=1.92\nsystem and log N(HI) = 16.33 \\pm 0.04 cm^-2 for the z=1.94 system. By comparing\nobserved ionic ratios of C and Si against calculations performed with the\nCLOUDY software package, we find the ionization state is high and well\nconstrained in both systems. Applying ionization corrections to the measured\nionic column densities, we determine that the systems exhibit significantly\ndifferent metallicities: ~ 1/50 solar and < 1/200 solar for the two components\nof z=1.92 and ~40% solar at z=1.94. The properties of the z=1.92 system are\nconsistent with a low metallicity galaxy (e.g. a dwarf galaxy) as well as\nabsorption by large scale structure of the IGM. On the other hand, the high\nmetallicity of the z=1.94 system suggests significant star formation and is\ntherefore most likely associated with a galactic system. Furthermore, we\npredict it is the most likely to be observed with the STIS imaging and\nfollow-up observations. If a galaxy is identified, our results provide direct\nmeasurements on the properties of the ISM for a z~2 galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 1998 01:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In an\ninhomogeneous universe reionization occurs outside-in, starting in voids and\ngradually penetrating into overdense regions. Reionization should not be sudden\nbut gradual, with a continuous rise of the photon mean free path over a fair\nfraction of the Hubble time as the emissivity increases.

In light of these models, I define quantum\ncomputers, and discuss the issue of universal quantum gates. Quantum\nalgorithms, including Shor's factorization algorithm and Grover's algorithm for\nsearching databases, are explained. I will devote much attention to\nunderstanding what the origins of the quantum computational power are, and what\nthe limits of this power are. Finally, I describe the recent theoretical\nresults which show that quantum computers maintain their complexity power even\nin the presence of noise, inaccuracies and finite precision. I tried to put all\nresults in their context, asking what the implications to other issues in\ncomputer science and physics are.
