Because this is so much simpler\nthan a standard inter-temporal equilibrium model, it is possible to study\nmulti-period markets analytically. There price dynamics have second order\noscillatory terms.\n  Value investing does not necessarily cause prices to track values. Trend\nfollowing causes short term trends in prices, but also causes longer-term\noscillations. When value investing and trend following are combined, even\nthough there is little linear structure, there can be boom-bust cycles,excess\nand temporally correlated volatility, and fat tails in price fluctuations. The\nlong term evolution of markets can be studied in terms of flows of money.\n  Profits can be decomposed in terms of aggregate pairwise correlations.\n  Under reinvestment of profits this leads to a capital allocation model that\nis equivalent to a standard model in population biology. An investigation of\nmarket efficiency shows that patterns created by trend followers are more\nresistant to efficiency than those created by value investors, and that profit\nmaximizing behavior slows the progression to efficiency.

The PL relation defined by Cepheids in the LMC is shown to\nbe excellent, although the distance to the LMC, which determines the\nzero-point, is still rather controversial. This LMC relation is consistent with\nthe galactic calibrations which use Hipparcos parallaxes or Baade-Wesselink\ndistances.

Ten percent of the\nH-alpha emission arises from extraplanar HII regions which appear to lie within\nfilamentary structures >3 kpc long above one side of the disk. The filaments\nemerge from the outer edge of a disk of bright H-alpha emission which is\nabruptly truncated beyond 0.35R(25). Together the truncated H-alpha disk and\nextraplanar H-alpha filaments are reminiscent of a bow shock morphology, which\nstrongly suggests that the interstellar medium (ISM) of NGC 4522 is being\nstripped by the gas pressure of the intracluster medium (ICM).
