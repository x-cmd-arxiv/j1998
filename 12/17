In M84 we estimate the\npressure on the disk required to overcome the torque from the galaxy and find\nthat it is small compared to the thermal pressure in the hot ambient ISM\nestimated from the X-ray emission. We therefore propose that pressure gradients\nin a jet associated hot interstellar medium exert a torque on the gas disk in\nM84 causing it to be misaligned with the galaxy isophotal major axis. This\nmechanism could explain the connection between gas disk angular momentum and\njet axes in nearby radio galaxies.\n  By integrating the light of the galaxy through a warped gas and dust disk we\nfind that the geometry of gas disk in M84 is likely to differ that predicted\nfrom a simple precession model. We find that the morphology of the gas disk in\nM84 is consistent with a warped geometry where precession is caused by a\ncombination of a galactic torque and a larger torque due to pressure gradients\nin the ambient X-ray emitting gas. Precession occurs at an axis between the jet\nand galaxy major axis, but nearer to the jet axis implying that the pressure\ntorque is 2-4 times larger than the galactic torque.

Another possibility is that\ngas was lost as a consequence of the episod of interaction or merger that\nproduced the system of shells visible in the optical band. Finally, the\npossible origins of the large scatter in the X-ray emission shown by galaxies\nof similar Lb are also reviewed.

The isolator, consisting of\na stack of metal disks connected by thin wires, attenuates frequencies in the\nkilohertz range, and is suited to both vacuum and cryogenic environments. We\nderive an approximate analytical model and compare its predictions for the\nfrequencies of the normal modes to those of a finite element analysis. The\nanalytical model is exact for the modes involving only motion along and\nrotation about the longitudinal axis, and it gives a good approximate\ndescription of the transverse modes. These results show that the high-frequency\nbehavior of a multi-stage isolator is well characterized by the natural\nfrequencies of a single stage. From the single-stage frequency formulae, we\nderive relationships among the various geometrical parameters of the isolator\nto guarantee equal attenuation in all degrees of freedom. We then derive\nexpressions for the attenuation attainable with a given isolator length, and\nfind that the most important limiting factor is the elastic limit of the spring\nwire material. For our application, which requires attenuations of 250 dB at 1\nkHz, our model specifies a six-stage design using brass disks of approximately\n2 cm in both radius and thickness, connected by 3 cm steel wires of diameters\nranging from 25 to 75 microns. We describe the construction of this isolator in\ndetail, and compare measurements of the natural frequencies of a single stage\nwith calculations from the analytical model and the finite element package. For\ntranslations along and rotations about the longitudinal axes, all three results\nare in agreement to within 10% accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 1998 20:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
