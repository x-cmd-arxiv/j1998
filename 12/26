The\nprocesses taken into account are neutrino emission due to Coulomb scattering of\nelectrons by atomic nuclei in a Coulomb liquid, and electron-phonon scattering\nand Bragg diffraction (the static-lattice contribution) in a Coulomb crystal.\nThe static-lattice contribution is calculated including the electron\nband-structure effects for cubic Coulomb crystals of different types and also\nfor the liquid crystal phases composed of rod- and plate-like nuclei in the\nneutron-star mantle (at 10^{14} - 1.5x10^{14} g/cm^3). The phonon contribution\nis evaluated with proper treatment of the multi-phonon processes which removes\na jump in the neutrino bremsstrahlung emissivity at the melting point obtained\nin previous works. Below 10^{13} g/cm^3, the results are rather insensitive to\nthe nuclear form factor, but results for the solid state near the melting point\nare affected significantly by the Debye-Waller factor and multi-phonon\nprocesses. At higher densities, the nuclear form factor becomes more\nsignificant. A comparison of the various neutrino generation mechanisms in\nneutron star crusts shows that electron bremsstrahlung is among the most\nimportant ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 1998 16:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}
