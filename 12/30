We show that t he\nclassical-quantum correspondences such as encodings can be treated as dia gonal\n(d-) entanglements. The mutual entropy of the d-compound and entangled states\nlead to two different types of entropies for a given quantum state: t he von\nNeumann entropy, which is achieved as the supremum of the information over all\nd-entanglements, and the dimensional entropy, which is achieved at the standard\nentanglement, the true quantum entanglement, coinciding with a d-entanglement\nonly in the case of pure marginal states.
