Nevertheless, it is clear that\ncertain generic properties related to orbital structure in a given potential\nand the effect of dissipation can be used to qualitatively understand gas\nmotion in galaxies. The effect of dissipation is examined in triaxial galaxy\npotentials with and without rotating time dependent components. In the former\ncase, dissipative trajectories settle around closed loop orbits when these\nexist. When they do not, e.g., inside a constant density core, then the only\nattractor is the centre and this leads to mass inflow. This provides a self\nregulating mechanism for accession of material towards the centre --- since the\nformation of a central masses destroys the central density core and eventually\nstops the accession. In the case when a rotating bar is present, there are\nusually several types of attractors, including those on which long lived\nchaotic motion can occur (strange attractors). Motion on these is erratic with\nlarge radial and vertical oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 1998 19:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The quark-gluon coupling is effectively\n(1+1)-dimensional and the theory contains four-quark operators which become\nrelevant as we approach to the Fermi sea. By calculating the one-loop vacuum\npolarization tensor in the effective theory, we find the electric gluons have a\nscreening mass, $M\\sim g_s\\mu$, while the static magnetic gluons are\nunscreened. We then investigate the gap equations for color anti-triplet Cooper\npairs by including both gluon-exchange interactions and the marginal four-quark\ninteractions in the effective theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 1998 15:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 1999 17:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 1999 20:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 1999 02:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A double-area cross-over design with area\nrandomization was adopted and an instrumented aircraft was used for seeding and\ncloud physical measurements. Finely pulverised salt (sodium chloride) particles\nwere released into the monsoon clouds (cumulus and stratocumulus) during\naircraft penetrations into the clouds at a height of 200-300 m above the\ncloud-base. The warm cloud responses to salt seeding are found to be critically\ndependent on the cloud physical characteristics e.g., vertical thickness and\nliquid water content. Clouds with vertical thickness greater than 1 km, LWC\ngreater than 0.5 gm/cubic m when seeded with salt particles (modal diameter 10\nmicro m, concentration 1 per litre of cloud air) produced increase in rainfall\nof 24 per cent significant at 4 per cent level.
