While the diffuse background measurements of COBE reveal the\nimportance of the far infrared and submillimeter in early galaxy and star\nformation, the understanding of the development of complex structure requires\nhigh resolution imaging and spectroscopy.\n  We present a concept for a space mission called SPECS, the Submillimeter\nProbe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure, which provides these capabilities.\nSPECS is a cold, spatial and spectral Michelson interferometer with adjustable\nbaselines ranging up to 1 km. It has Hubble sensitivity and angular resolution\nin the far IR and submillimeter, spectral resolution up to 10,000, and a 14'\nfield of view. SPECS will be able to image thermal dust continuum and infrared\ncooling and diagnostic line emission over a wide range of redshifts, providing\nextinction-free astrophysical probes of young galaxies and early cosmic\nstructures, and measures of the luminosity and heavy element formation history\nof the universe. SPECS would also have the potential to improve vastly our\nknowledge of protostars, protoplanetary systems, Active Galactic Nuclei and\nother objects in the local universe.\n  We recommend that a concerted effort be made during the next decade to\ndevelop and test certain critical technologies (photon-counting far IR\ndetectors, formation flying spacecraft, cold, lightweight mirrors, and active\ncoolers), so that SPECS can be deployed in about 2015.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 1998 20:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}
