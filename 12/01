Prior work has focused on\nboth unstable and (potentially) stable disc oscillations. The former has often\nbeen suspected of being the underlying cause for the observed broad-band\nvariability in BHC, whereas the latter has had little observational motivation\nuntil quite recently. In this article, we review both the observations and\ntheory of (predominantly) stable oscillations in BHC systems. We discuss how\nvariability, both broad-band and quasi-periodic, is characterized in BHC. We\nreview previous claims of low frequency features in BHC, and we discuss the\nrecent observational evidence for stable, high frequency oscillations in\nso-called `galactic microquasars'. As a potential explanation for the latter\nobservations, we concentrate on a class of theories-- with a rich history of\nstudy-- that we call `diskoseismology'. We also discuss other recent\nalternative theories, namely Lense-Thirring precession of tilted rings near the\ndisc inner edge. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of these\ntheories, and discuss possible future directions for study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 1998 02:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Cygnus A appears to have a particularly simple\nmerger geometry that allows an estimate of the subcluster collision velocity\nfrom the observed temperature variations. We estimate it to be ~2000 km/s.\nInterestingly, this is similar to the free-fall velocity that the two Cygnus A\nsubclusters should have achieved at the observed separation, suggesting that\nmerger has been effective in dissipating the kinetic energy of gas halos into\nthermal energy, without channeling its major fraction elsewhere (e.g., into\nturbulence). In A3667, we may be observing a spatial lag between the shock\nfront seen in the X-ray image and the corresponding rise of the electron\ntemperature. A lag of the order of hundreds of kiloparsecs is possible due to\nthe combination of thermal conduction and a finite electron-ion equilibration\ntime. Forthcoming better spatial resolution data will allow a direct\nmeasurement of these phenomena using such lags. A2065 has gas density peaks\ncoincident with two central galaxies. A merger with the collision velocity\nestimated from the temperature map should have swept away such peaks if the\nsubcluster total mass distributions had flat cores in the centers. The fact\nthat the peaks have survived (or quickly reemerged) suggests that the\ngravitational potential also is strongly peaked.

However this theory has encountered certain\nconceptual difficulties like non-locality in time, self force of the electron,\npre acceleration and the perfect absorption condition of Feynman and Wheeler,\nthat is the instantaneous action of the remaining charges in the universe on\nthe charge in question. More recently, Hoyle and Narlikar have resurrected this\ntheory, but within the context of a Steady State or Quasi Steady State\ncosmology. They argue that the theory infact has a better standing than the\ngenerally accepted quantum theoretic description. In this article we consider a\nquantum theoretic description and a cosmology which parallels the\nHoyle-Narlikar approach. This leads to a synthesis and justification of the\nDirac and Feynman-Wheeler approaches, clarifying the conceptual problems in the\nprocess. We deduce a scenario with quantized space-time and a holistic\ncosmology, consistent with physical and astrophysical data. The non-locality is\nnow seen to be meaningful within the minimum space-time intervals, as also the\nperfect absorption within the holistic description. Local realism, and the\nusual causal field theory are seen to have an underpinning of direct action.\nFor example this is brought out by the virtual photons which mediate\ninteractions in Quantum Electro Dynamics, and the emergence of the inverse\nsquare law in the above approach from a background Zero Point Field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 1998 10:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It was shown in a previous paper that, modulo U-duality\ntransformations of E_{7(7)} the most general solution of this type can be\nreduced to a black-hole of the STU model. In this paper we analize this\nsolution in detail, considering in particular its embedding in one of the\npossible Special K\\\"ahler manifold compatible with the consistent truncations\nto N=2 supergravity, this manifold being the moduli space of the T^6/Z^3\norbifold, that is: SU(3,3)/SU(3)*U(3). This construction requires a crucial use\nof the Solvable Lie Algebra formalism. Once the group-theoretical analisys is\ndone, starting from a static, spherically symmetric ans\\\"atz, we find an exact\nsolution for all the scalars (both dilaton and axion-like) and for gauge\nfields, together with their already known charge-dependent fixed values, which\nyield a U-duality invariant entropy. We give also a complete translation\ndictionary between the Solvable Lie Algebra and the Special K\\\"ahler formalisms\nin order to let comparison with other papers on similar issues being more\nimmediate.

The flow of neutrons\nwas extracted from the slope at mid-rapidity of the curve of the average\nin-plane momentum vs the center-of-mass rapidity. The squeeze-out of the\nparticipant neutrons was observed in a direction normal to the reaction plane\nin the normalized momentum coordinates in the center-of-mass system.\nExperimental results of the neutron squeeze-out were compared with BUU\ncalculations. The polar-angle dependence of the maximum azimuthal anisotropy\nratio $r(\\theta)$ was found to be insensitive to the mass of the colliding\nnuclei and the beam energy.
