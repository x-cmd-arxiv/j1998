The resonant energy\ntransfer between the orbit and NS speeds up or slows down the inspiral and\ninduces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. A\ntidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the\norbital frequency. For f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the NS\nmust have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s>710Hz for (22,2)-resonance\nand nu_s>570Hz for (33,3)-resonance (M=1.4Mo and R=10km; however, for R=15km,\nthese spin frequencies become 330Hz and 250Hz). Because of strong tidal\ncoupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital\ncycles, N_orb, with maximum N_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and N_orb~1 for\n(33,3)- resonance. Such resonant effects, if present, must be included in\nconstructing waveform templates used in searching for gravitational wave\nsignals. Higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, but\nN_orb<0.1. For the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation\n(nu_s<100Hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting resonance\nto a smaller orbital frequency. However, because of the weak coupling, N_orb\nlies in the range 10^-3-10^-2 (depending on the NS EOS) and is probably\nnegligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. R-mode resonances\nrequire misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonances\ncorrespond to (22,3) and (22,1). Since tidal coupling depends strongly on\nrotation rate, N_orb<10^-2(R/10km)^(10)(M/1.4Mo)^(-20/3) is negligible for\ncanonical NS parameters but can be appreciable if the NS radius is larger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 1998 04:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 1999 01:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Numerically it is found that such a division is\nimportant in understanding many properties of both eigenstates and the\nso-called local spectral density of states (LDOS). For the average shape of\neigenstates, its central part is found to be composed of its non-perturbative\npart and a region of its perturbative part, which is close to the\nnon-perturbative part. A relationship between the average shape of eigenstates\nand that of LDOS can be explained.

To this end we introduce the Quantum Dissipative\nVillain Model (QDVM), which models tunneling of a degree of freedom coupled to\na linear quantum environment through an infinite set of states. We derive\ngeneral exact mappings on various dual discrete representations\n(one-dimensional Coulomb gases or surface roughening models) which are exactly\nself-dual. Then we show how the QDVM maps exactly onto the WB model and use\nduality relations to calculate the leading terms of the total impedance of a JJ\ncircuit, for general frequency dependence of the spectral density of the\nenvironment and arbitrary temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 1998 14:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This generalizes the model structure defined by Quillen in 1969 for\n2-reduced coalgebras. In our case, the notion of weak equivalence is structly\nstronger than that of quasi-isomorphism. A pair of adjoint functors connecting\nthe category of coalgebras with the category of dg Lie algebras, induces an\nequivalence of the corresponding homotopy categories.\n  The model category structure allows one to consider dg coalgebras as very\ngeneral formal stacks. The corresponding Lie algebra is then interpreted as a\ntangent Lie algebra which defines the formal stack uniquely up to a weak\nequivalence.\n  An example of the coalgebra of formal deformaions of a principal $G$-bundle\non a scheme $X$ is calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 1998 18:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
