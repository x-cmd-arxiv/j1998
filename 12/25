We\napply successive Lorentz transformations and the relativistic equation of light\npropagation to establish the exact treatment of Doppler effect in binary\nsystems both in special and general relativity theories. As a result, the\nDoppler shift is a sum of (1) linear in $c^{-1}$ terms, which include the\nordinary Doppler effect and its variation due to the secular radial\nacceleration of the binary with respect to observer; (2) terms proportional to\n$c^{-2}$, which include the contributions from the quadratic Doppler effect\ncaused by the relative motion of binary star with respect to the Solar system,\nmotion of the particle emitting light and diurnal rotational motion of\nobserver, orbital motion of the star around the binary's barycenter, and\norbital motion of the Earth; and (3) terms proportional to $c^{-2}$, which\ninclude the contributions from redshifts due to gravitational fields of the\nstar, star's companion, Galaxy, Solar system, and the Earth.
