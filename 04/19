These data - together with high\nquality optical spectra of T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga cloud -\ndemonstrate that forbidden emission lines are stronger and more common in class\nI sources than in T Tauri stars. Our results also provide a clear discriminant\nin the frequency of forbidden line emission between weak-emission and classical\nT Tauri stars. In addition to strong emission lines, three class I sources have\nprominent TiO absorption bands. The M-type central stars of these sources\nmingle with optically visible T Tauri stars in the HR diagram and lie somewhat\nbelow both the birthline for spherical accretion and the deuterium burning\nsequence for disc accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 1998 19:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Runaway growth occurs in 100 Myr for 10 earth\nmasses and an initial eccentricity of 0.001 in a 6 AU annulus centered at 35\nAU. This mass is close to the amount of dusty material expected in a minimum\nmass solar nebula extrapolated into the Kuiper Belt.\n  Simulations with velocity evolution produce runaway growth on a wide range of\ntime scales. Dynamical friction and viscous stirring increase particle\nvelocities in models with large (8 km radius) initial bodies. This velocity\nincrease delays runaway growth by a factor of two compared to models without\nvelocity evolution. In contrast, collisional damping dominates over dynamical\nfriction and viscous stirring in models with small (80--800 m radius) initial\nbodies. Collisional damping decreases the time scale to runaway growth by\nfactors of 4--10 relative to constant velocity calculations. Simulations with\nminimum mass solar nebulae, 10 earth masses, reach runaway growth on time\nscales of 20-40 Myr with 80 m initial bodies, 50-100 Myr with 800 m bodies, and\n75-250 Myr for 8 km initial bodies.
