The computation is rather simple,\nand involves calculating several Feynman diagrams, using dimensional\nregularization. The results agree well with data and indicate that the\nexpansion is converging. They do not suffer from any ambiguities arising from\noff-shell versus on-shell amplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 1998 23:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 1998 21:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 1998 00:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
