We consider that merger progenitor disks begin to\nconsume interstellar gas at moderate rate from z ~ 5 and then merge to form an\nelliptical with the secondary starburst at z=z_merge. We find that even if the\nepoch of galaxy merging is rather extended (0.3<z_merge<3.0), the dispersion in\nthe rest-frame U-V color among galaxy mergers is well within the observed one\n(~0.05 mag at z = 0). We also find that the z_merge is required to be within a\ncertain range to keep the observed C-M relation tight at a given z. For\nexample, the required range of z_merge in galaxy mergers between Sa disks is\n1.3<z_merge<3.0 for cluster ellipticals at z = 0.895, 0.9<z_merge<3.0 for z =\n0.55, and 0.3<z_merge<3.0 for z = 0. The main reason for the derived small\nscatter is that younger stellar populations, which are formed during the\nsecondary starburst of galaxy mergers, are formed preferentially from more\nmetal-enriched interstellar gas. This result reinforces the Worthey's\nsuggestion (Worthey et al. 1996) that the age-metallicity conspiracy, which\nmeans that younger stellar populations are preferentially more metal-enriched,\ncan operate to keep the tight C-M relation. These numerical results imply that\nthe observed small scatter in the C-M relation at low and intermediate redshift\n(z < 1) does not necessarily require the coevality of elliptical galaxies in\nclusters or their formation at high z, which has been conventionally believed\nin the classical passive evolution picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 1998 09:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Applying the semiconductor\nQLEs to semiconductor light-emitting devices (LEDs), we obtain a new formula\nfor the Fano factor of photons which gives the photon-number statistics as a\nfunction of the pump statistics and several parameters of LEDs. Key ingredients\nare non-radiative processes, carrier-number dependence of the radiative and\nnon-radiative lifetimes, and multimodeness of LEDs. The formula is applicable\nto the actual cases where the quantum efficiency $\\eta$ differs from the\ndifferential quantum efficiency $\\eta_{d}$, whereas previous theories\nimplicitly assumed $\\eta = \\eta_{d}$. It is also applicable to the cases when\nphotons in each mode of the cavity are emitted and/or detected inhomogeneously.\nWhen $\\eta_{d} < \\eta$ at a running point, in particular, our formula predicts\nthat even a Poissonian pump can produce sub-Poissonian light. This mechanism\nfor generation of sub-Poissonian light is completely different from those of\nprevious theories, which assumed sub-Poissonian statistics for the current\ninjected into the active layers of LEDs.
