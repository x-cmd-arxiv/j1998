As a strange star might be an\nintensely magnetized rotator, the induced unipolar electric field would be\nlarge enough to construct a magnetosphere around the strange matter core.\n  This kind of magnetosphere is very similar to that of the rotating magnetized\nneutron stars discussed by many authors. A magnetosphere will be established\nvery soon through pair production by gamma-B or two photon processes after a\nstrange star was born in a supernova explosion. It is emphasized that the fact\nthat the strange star surface can not supply charged particles does not stop\nthe formation of a space charge separated magnetosphere around the bare strange\nstar. An accretion crust is quite difficult to come into being around an\nisolated strange star. Therefore the observed radio signals of an\nrotation-powered pulsar may come from a bare strange stars rather than a\nneutron stars or a strange star with an accretion crust. The idea, that the\nradio pulsars are the strange stars without crusts, is supported by some\nobservations. The fact, that the iron emission lines have been observed in many\nX-ray pulsars but never been reported in X-ray emission of radio pulsars, is\ndifficult to be understood if the radio pulsars are the neutron stars or\nstrange star with crust where the surface binding energy of iron ions is too\nlow to avoid a ion free-flow from the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 1998 13:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

If an underlying form has outputs that can meet a given constraint,\nlenient composition enforces the constraint; if none of the output candidates\nmeet the constraint, lenient composition allows all of them.

Our method\ncovers the case of surfaces of general type with Picard group ${\\Bbb Z}$ and\n$(13+12\\theta_2) c_1^2 - 9 c_2 > 0$, where $\\theta_2$ is what we call the\n\"2-jet threshold\" (the 2-jet threshold turns out to be bounded below by -1/6\nfor surfaces in ${\\Bbb P}^3$). The final conclusion is obtained by using very\nrecent results of McQuillan on holomorphic foliations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 1998 07:06:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 1999 14:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is found that, in contrast with the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect in flat space, integer values of the numerical flux can produce\nobservable effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 1998 12:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
