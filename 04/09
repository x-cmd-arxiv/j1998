In this\nfirst version no hard processes, aside from Drell-Yan production, are included.\nThe space-time history of the hard phase is then used as input to reconstruct\nsoft energy-loss, which occurs over a longer time scale. Soft meson production\nis therefore treated as coherent over groups of interacting nucleons. Two body\ndata, though, are used extensively to guide the reinitialisation of the\ncascade, which satisfies conservation laws for charge, strangeness and of\ncourse, energy-momentum. A second phase, low energy cascade is finally carried\nout among the products of the hard cascade.

Section 6 presents\nthree alternative formalisms for quantizing solitons (topological or\nnontopological), all of which have major implications for the foundations of\nquantum theory: (1) the standard formalism, based on functional integration,\nreinterpreted as an imaginary Markhov Random Field (iMRF) across time and\nspace, with parallels to fuzzy logic; (2) two radically conservative\nformalisms, consistent with the core of Einstein's vision, based on a true MRF\nmodel. Bell's Theorem, bosonization, time-symmetry and macroscopic asymmetry\nare discussed, along with some testable alternative possibilities and heresies,\nlike nonDoppler redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 1998 21:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
