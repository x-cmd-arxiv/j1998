It is shown that these CA\nactually conserve the total density, rather than merely classifying it. This is\nalso the criterion for any CA simulation of DFT. The effect of boundary and\nperiodicity conditions upon the evolution of such CA are elaborated by\nconsidering linear and cyclic lattices and boundary conditions consistent with\nthe conservation criterion. In a bounded linear lattice, it is possible to\nachieve a configuration with a single 01 and no 10 domain wall, or vice versa,\nbut this is not possible in a cyclic lattice, where these two domain walls have\nto appear in pairs. This determines the final stable state of the automaton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 1998 23:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
