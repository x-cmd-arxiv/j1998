The detailed analysis of\nexcitation-deactivation kinetics, rate constants of various collisional and\nradiative transitions and fitting procedures made it possible to develop two\nnew methods of diagnostics of: (1) the ground $X^{1}\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ state\nvibrational temperature $T_{\\text{vib}}$ from the relative intensity\ndistribution, and (2) the rate of electron impact dissociation\n$(d[\\mbox{H$_{2}$}]/dt)_{\\text{diss}}$ from the absolute intensity of the\ncontinuum. A known method of determination of $T_{\\text{vib}}$ from relative\nintensities of Fulcher-$\\alpha$ bands was seriously corrected and simplified\ndue to the revision of $d \\to a$ transition probabilities and cross sections of\n$d \\gets X$ electron impact excitation.

The dynamic\naperture and other properties of the lattice, as k becomes large, will be\ncalled the high multipole limit. It will be shown that the high multipole limit\nprovides a reasonable estimate of the dynamic aperture of an accelerator, and\nthe other properties of the high multipole limit found below are useful for\nunderstanding the stability of the accelerator. The high multipole limit is\neasily computed and it also provides an estimate of how much can be gained by\ncorrecting the lower field multipoles. The above results will be illustrated by\ntracking studies done with a simple one cell lattice, and with a RHIC lattice\nhaving six low beta insertions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 1998 13:51:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 1998 14:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
