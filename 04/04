The compatible Poisson bracket on G is non-linear, but it can still be\nrealized as a ``cocycle perturbation'' of the linear Poisson bracket. We\nconstruct a certain twisted group C*-algebra A, which is shown to be a strict\ndeformation quantization of G. Motivated by the data at the Poisson (classical)\nlevel, we then construct on A its locally compact quantum group structures:\ncomultiplication, counit, antipode and Haar weight, as well as its associated\nmultiplicative unitary operator. We also find a quasitriangular ``quantum\nuniversal R-matrix'' type operator for A, which agrees well with the\nquasitriangularity at the Lie bialgebra level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 1998 20:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 1999 13:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
