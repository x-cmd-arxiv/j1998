We examined stimulus-elicited spike count response\ndistributions in V1 and IT cortices of awake monkeys. In both areas the\ndistribution of spike counts for each stimulus was well-described by a\nGaussian, with the log of the variance in the spike count linearly related to\nthe log of the mean spike count. Two significant differences in response\ncharacteristics were found: both the range of spike counts and the slope of the\nlog(variance) vs. log(mean) regression were larger in V1 than in IT. However,\nneurons in the two areas transmitted approximately the same amount of\ninformation about the stimuli, and had about the same channel capacity (the\nmaximum possible transmitted information given noise in the responses). These\nresults suggest that neurons in V1 use more variable signals over a larger\ndynamic range than neurons in IT, which use less variable signals over a\nsmaller dynamic range. The two coding strategies are approximately as effective\nin transmitting information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 1998 21:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
