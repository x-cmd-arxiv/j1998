The angular separation is 36 arcsec and corresponds to transverse\nlinear separations between lines of sight of $\\sim300h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc ($q_{o}$\n= 0.5) over the redshift range 0.833 < z < 1.438. From the observed numbers of\ncoincident and anti-coincident Ly$\\alpha$ absorption lines, we conclude that,\nat this redshift, the Ly$\\alpha$ structures have typical dimensions of\n$\\sim500h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc, larger than the mean separation of the two lines of\nsight. The velocity difference, $\\Delta V$, between coincident lines is\nsurprisingly small (4 and 8 pairs with $\\Delta V < 50 and 200 km/s\nrespectively).\n  Metal line systems are present at $z_{abs}$ = 1.2651 and 1.2969 in A,\n$z_{abs}$ = 0.6320, 0.7090, 1.2651 and 1.4844 in B. In addition we tentatively\nidentify a weak Mg II system at $z_{abs}$ = 0.11 in B. It is remarkable that\nthe $z_{abs}$ = 1.2651 system is common to both lines of sight. The system at\n$z_{abs}$ = 1.4844 %is probably associated and has strong O~VI absorption.\n  There is a metal-poor associated system at $z_{abs}$ = 1.4420 along the line\nof sight to A with complex velocity profile. We detect a strong Ly$\\alpha$\nabsorption along the line of sight to B redshifted by only 300 km/s relatively\nto the associated system. It is tempting to interpret this as the presence of a\ndisk of radius larger than 300$h^{-1}_{50}$ kpc surrounding quasar A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 1998 11:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For the lowest $p=1$ (homogeneous)\nharmonic numerical solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for different scalar\nfield potentials $V$ and different initial data show that in some cases the\npotential $U$ is negative in the intermediate region.

These factors parallel another dividing\nfactor studied previously, HL, that yields a (different) reduced response which\nfulfills the Coulomb sum rule. GL, GT and HL are all found to be only very\nweakly model-dependent, thus providing essentially universal dividing factors.\nTo explore the residual degree of dependence which remains, the scaling and sum\nrule properties of several specific models have been considered. It is seen\nthat the relativistic Fermi gas (by construction) and also typical shell-model\nreduced responses successfully scale and satisfy the Coulomb sum rule, as do\nexperimental results at medium to high momentum transfers. On the other hand,\nit is observed that the quantum hadrodynamic model does so only if interaction\neffects become weaker with increasing momentum transfer, as predicted in the\nmost recent versions of that model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 1998 09:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A macroscopic approach is adopted in which the averaged force is\ncomputed from the Maxwell stress tensor. The particular case of a perfectly\nreflecting wall and a sphere with a dielectric function given by the Drude\nmodel is examined in detail. It is found that the force can be expressed as the\nsum of a monotonically decaying function of position and of an oscillatory\npiece. At large separations, the oscillatory piece is the dominant\ncontribution, and is much larger than the Casimir-Polder interaction that\narises in the limit that the sphere is a perfect conductor.

In the limit of a perfectly conducting sphere,\nthere are cancellations between different parts of the spectrum which no longer\noccur as completely in the case of a sphere with frequency dependent\npolarizability.
