By comparing these expectations to the properties of globular\ncluster systems of today's elliptical galaxies we can constrain merger models.\nThe observational data indicate that i) every gaseous merger induces the\nformation of new star clusters, ii) the number of new clusters formed in such a\nmerger increases with the gas content of the progenitor galaxies.\nLow-luminosity (about M_V>-21), disky ellipticals are generally thought to be\nthe result of a gaseous merger. As such, new globular clusters are expected to\nform but have not been detected to date. We investigate various reasons for the\nnon-detection of sub-populations in low-luminosity ellipticals, i.e. absence of\nan old population, absence of a new population, destruction of one of the\npopulations, and finally, an age-metallicity conspiracy that allows old and new\nglobular clusters to appear indistinguishable at the present epoch. All of\nthese possibilities lead us to a similar conclusion, namely that low-luminosity\nellipticals did not form recently (z<1) in a gas-rich merger, and might not\nhave formed in a major merger of stellar systems at all. High-luminosity\nellipticals do reveal globular cluster sub-populations. However, it is\ndifficult to account for the two populations in terms of mergers alone, and in\nparticular, we can rule out scenarios in which the second sub-population is the\nproduct of a recent, gas-poor merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 1998 16:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The former state, the \"breaking\"\nstate, cuts off with e-folding energy ~100 keV and has its peak luminosity near\nthis energy. In contrast, the latter state has luminosity peaking in the soft\nX-rays and an unbroken power law spectrum, even up to energies above 500 keV in\nsome cases.\n  The breaking gamma-ray spectrum can be well modeled by Comptonization of soft\nphotons in a hot thermal plasma.

This places a severe limit on the size of the computations that can\nbe performed by such a computer; estimates of that limit are well within the\nrange in which a conventional computer taking exponentially more steps would\nstill be practical.\n  We give an NMR implementation in which the signal-to-noise ratio depends only\non features of NMR technology, not the size of the computer.
