In these stars, the radiative layer contributes to mode damping\nbecause its opacity decreases upon compression and the amplitude of the\nLagrangian pressure perturbation increases outward. The overlying convective\nenvelope is the seat of mode excitation because it acts as an insulating\nblanket with respect to the perturbed flux that enters it from below. A crucial\npoint is that the convective motions respond to the instantaneous pulsational\nstate. Driving exceeds damping by as much as a factor of two provided\n$\\omega\\tau_c\\geq 1$, where $\\omega$ is the radian frequency of the mode and\n$\\tau_c\\approx 4\\tau_{th}$ with $\\tau_{th}$ being the thermal time constant\nevaluated at the base of the convective envelope. As a white dwarf cools, its\nconvection zone deepens, and modes of lower frequency become overstable.\nHowever, the deeper convection zone impedes the passage of flux perturbations\nfrom the base of the convection zone to the photosphere. Thus the photometric\nvariation of a mode with constant velocity amplitude decreases. These factors\naccount for the observed trend that longer period modes are found in cooler\nDAVs. The linear growth time, ranging from hours for the longest period\nobserved modes ($P\\approx 20$ minutes) to thousands of years for those of\nshortest period ($P\\approx 2 $ minutes), probably sets the time-scale for\nvariations of mode amplitude and phase. This is consistent with observations\nshowing that longer period modes are more variable than shorter period ones.\nOur investigation confirms many results obtained by Brickhill in his pioneering\nstudies of ZZ Cetis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 1998 16:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-08"}

Such tasks include machine\ntranslation, information retrieval, parsing, natural language understanding and\nlexicography. Reflecting the growth in utilization of machine readable texts,\nword sense disambiguation techniques have been explored variously in the\ncontext of corpus-based approaches. Within one corpus-based framework, that is\nthe similarity-based method, systems use a database, in which example sentences\nare manually annotated with correct word senses. Given an input, systems search\nthe database for the most similar example to the input. The lexical ambiguity\nof a word contained in the input is resolved by selecting the sense annotation\nof the retrieved example. In this research, we apply this method of resolution\nof verbal polysemy, in which the similarity between two examples is computed as\nthe weighted average of the similarity between complements governed by a target\npolysemous verb. We explore similarity-based verb sense disambiguation focusing\non the following three methods. First, we propose a weighting schema for each\nverb complement in the similarity computation. Second, in similarity-based\ntechniques, the overhead for manual supervision and searching the large-sized\ndatabase can be prohibitive. To resolve this problem, we propose a method to\nselect a small number of effective examples, for system usage. Finally, the\nefficiency of our system is highly dependent on the similarity computation\nused. To maximize efficiency, we propose a method which integrates the\nadvantages of previous methods for similarity computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 1998 12:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We demonstrate both\nanalytically and in practical examples (1) that the LMF does neither correspond\nto the infinite momentum frame (IMF) nor to the front-form (FF) (2) that the\nLMF is not equivalent to the IMF (3) that the IMF is unphysical since it\nviolates the lattice scaling window and (4) that the FF is even more unphysical\nbecause FF propagators violate micro-causality, causality and the finiteness of\nthe speed of light. We argue that distribution functions measured in deep\ninelastic scattering should be interpreted in the LMF (preferably in the Breit\nframe) rather than in the FF formalism. In particular, we argue that deep\ninelastic scattering probes space-like distribution functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 1998 04:05:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 1998 19:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
