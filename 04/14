We investigate spherically symmetric supernova fallback using a\nrelativistic radiation hydrodynamics Lagrangian code that handles radiation\ntransport in all regimes. Our goal is to answer the fundamental question: did\nSN1987A produce a black hole and, if so, when will the hole become detectable ?\nWe compute the light curve, assuming that a black hole has been formed during\nthe explosion, and compare it with the observations. Our preliminary\ncalculations lack radioactive energy input and adopt a very simple chemical\ncomposition (pure hydrogen). As a result, our computed models cannot fit the\nobserved data of SN1987A in detail. Nevertheless, we can show that, during the\nfirst hours, the accretion flow is self--regulated and the accretion luminosity\nstays very close to the Eddington limit. The light curve is completely\ndominated, during the first few weeks, by the emission of the stellar envelope\nthermal energy, and resembles that obtained in ``standard'' supernova theory.\nOnly long after hydrogen recombination takes place is there even a chance to\nactually detect radiation from the accreting black hole above the emission of\nthe expanding envelope. The presence of a black hole is thus not inconsistent\nwith observations to date. Because of the exponential decay of the $^{44}$Ti\nradioactive heating rate, the date of the emergence of the black hole is not\nvery sensitive to the actual parameters of the models and turns out to be about\n1000 years. The bulk of the emission then is expected to be in the visible\nband, but will be unobservable with present instrumentation. We discuss the\nimplications of our results in connection with the possible emergence of a\nblack hole in other supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 1998 19:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We argue that in most cases orientifolds contain\nnon-perturbative sectors that are missing in the world-sheet approach. These\nnon-perturbative sectors can be thought of as arising from D-branes wrapping\nvarious collapsed 2-cycles in the orbifold. Using these observations, we\nexplain certain ``puzzles'' in the literature on four dimensional orientifolds.\nIn particular, in some four dimensional orientifolds the ``naive'' tadpole\ncancellation conditions have no solution. However, these tadpole cancellation\nconditions are derived using the world-sheet approach which we argue to be\ninadequate in these cases due to appearance of additional non-perturbative\nsectors. The main tools in our analyses are the map between F-theory and\norientifold vacua and Type I-heterotic duality. Utilizing the consistency\nconditions we have found in this paper, we discuss consistent four dimensional\nchiral ${\\cal N}=1$ Type I vacua which are non-perturbative from the heterotic\nviewpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 1998 23:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 May 1998 07:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
