The size of the polar cap increases as the field decays, and is set\nby the last open field line before the accretion disk. Below the polar cap we\nfind the temperature to be so high that electron-phonon scattering dominates\nthe resistivity. Outside the polar cap region, the temperature is such the\nresistivity is dominated by temperature independent impurity scattering which\ncan be a few orders of magnitude larger than the electron- phonon resistivity.\nThe time-scale for field decay is therefore initially given by impurity\nscattering dominated resistivity. When the field strength has been reduced to\n$\\sim 10^8 gauss$ the accretion is spherical and the time scale for field decay\nis given by the smaller electron-phonon scattering resistivity. The field\nstrength is now reduced rapidly compared to before and this could be a reason\nfor there being no pulsars known with field strengths below $10^8 gauss$. We\nalso investigate the evolution of multipoles at the neutron star surface. We\nfind that contribution from higher-order multipoles are at most 30% to that of\nthe dipole mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 1998 23:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
