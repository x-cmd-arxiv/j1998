A physical nuclear equation of state\nis used that allows us to follow the thermodynamical evolution of the stellar\nmatter and to compute the emission of neutrinos. Predicted gravitational wave\nsignals, luminosities and waveforms, are presented. The models are evaluated\nfor their implications for gamma-ray burst scenarios. We find an extremely\nluminous outburst of neutrinos with a peak luminosity of more than 4E54 erg/s\nfor several milliseconds. This leads to an efficiency of about 1% for the\nannihilation of neutrinos with antineutrinos, corresponding to an average\nenergy deposition rate of more than 1E52 erg/s and a total energy of about 1E50\nerg deposited in electron-positron pairs around the collision site within 10ms.\nAlthough these numbers seem very favorable for gamma-ray burst scenarios, the\npollution of the $e^\\pm$ pair-plasma cloud with nearly 0.1$M_{\\odot}$ of\ndynamically ejected baryons is 5 orders of magnitude too large.

The advantage of using large\ncontiguous surveys for measuring clustering properties on even modest angular\nscales is substantial: the effects of cosmic scatter are strongly suppressed.\nWe provide highly accurate measurements of the two-point angular correlation\nfunction, w(theta), as a function of magnitude on scales up to 1.5 degrees. The\namplitude of w(theta) declines by a factor of ~10 over the range 16 <= I <= 20\nbut only by a factor of 2 - 3 over the range 20 < I <= 23.

Making use of\nlattice-model simulations we find that both ordered and disordered aggregation\narise from elementary structures which eventually build the folding nucleus of\nthe heteropolymers, and takes place when some of the most strongly interacting\namino acids establish their contacts leading to the formation of a specific\nsubset of the native structure. These elementary structures can be viewed as\nthe partially folded intermediates suggested to be involved in the aggregation\nof a number of proteins. These results have evolutionary implications, as the\nelementary structures forming the folding core of designed proteins contain the\nresidues which are conserved among the members of homologous sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 1998 16:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is proved that M is a homogeneous space G/H. It is symmetric if\nand only if the U-vectors governing the sigma-model metric are either\ncoinciding or mutually orthogonal. For nonzero noncoinciding U-vectors the\nKilling equations are solved. Using a block-orthogonal decomposition of the set\nof the U-vectors it is shown that under rather general assumptions the algebra\nof Killing vectors is a direct sum of several copies of sl(2,R) algebras\n(corresponding to 1-vector blocks), several solvable Lie algebras\n(corresponding to multivector blocks) and the Killing algebra of a flat space.\nThe target space manifold is decomposed in a product of a flat space, several\n2-dimensional spaces of constant curvature (e.g. Lobachevsky space, part of\nanti-de Sitter space) and several solvable Lie group manifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 1998 13:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 1998 09:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
