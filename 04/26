Goldberg & Wo\\'zniak\\markcite{goldberg1997} actually applied\nthis method to the OGLE-1 database and found that 7 out of 15 events showed\nsignificant centroid shifts of $\\delta x \\gtrsim 0.2$ arcsec. The amount of\ncentroid shift has been estimated theoretically by\nGoldberg.\\markcite{goldberg1997} However, he treated the problem in general and\ndid not apply it to a particular survey or field, and thus based his estimates\non simple toy model luminosity functions (i.e., power laws). In this paper, we\nconstruct the expected distribution of $\\delta x$ for Galactic bulge events by\nusing the precise stellar LF observed by Holtzman et al.\\markcite{holtzman1998}\nusing HST. Their LF is complete up to $M_I\\sim 9.0$ ($M_V\\sim 12$),\ncorresponding to faint M-type stars. In our analysis we find that regular\nblending cannot produce a large fraction of events with measurable centroid\nshifts. By contrast, a significant fraction of events would have measurable\ncentroid shifts if they are affected by amplification-bias blending. Therefore,\nGoldberg & Wo\\'zniak's measurements of large centroid shifts for a large\nfraction of microlensing events confirms the prediction of Han and Alard that a\nlarge fraction of Galactic bulge events are affected by amplification-bias\nblending.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 1998 13:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

To account for the\nrarity of binary source events, Dominik pointed out that for a typical binary\nsource event the separation between the component source stars is very large,\nresulting in large difference in impact parameters between the component binary\nsource stars. In these cases, the light curve of the highly amplified source\nstar is barely affected by the light from the other star, making the observed\nbinary source light curve difficult to distinguish from that of a single source\nlensing event. In this paper, we determine the fraction of events with similar\nsource star amplifications is as much as $\\sim 8%$, and thus show that the very\nlow detection rate for binary source events cannot be explained by this effect\nalone. By carrying out realistic simulations of binary source events, we find\nthat a significant fraction of binary source events are additionally missed\nfrom detection due to various other reasons. First, if the flux ratio between\nthe component stars is very large, the light curve of the bright star is hardly\naffected by the light from the faint star. Second, if the separation is too\nsmall, the binary source stars behave like a single star, making it difficult\nto separate the binary source event from a single event. Finally, although the\nprobability of detecting binary source events increases as the source\nseparation increases, still some fraction of binary source events will be\nmissed because the light curves of these events will mimic those of single\nsource events with longer timescales and larger values of the impact parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 1998 14:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
