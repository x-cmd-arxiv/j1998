These\nresults should be useful for taking into account the nuclear effects in\nanalyses of experimental data in neutrino reactions in nuclear targets, and\ntest QCD predictions for the nucleon structure functions. In particular, the\nsize of the nuclear corrections is of the same order of magnitude as the size\nof the QCD corrections to the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 1998 10:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The time evolution of the\nvelocity and position distribution function is described by a linear Boltzmann\nequation (LBE). The small ratio of electron to neutral masses, $\\epsilon$,\nmakes the energy transfer between them very inefficient. We show that under\nsuitable scalings the LBE reduces, in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, to a formally\nexact equation for the speed (energy) and position distribution of the\nelectrons which contains mixed spatial and speed derivatives. When the system\nis spatially homogeneous this equation reduces to and thus justifies, for\n$\\epsilon$ small enough, the commonly used ``two-term'' approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 1998 19:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
