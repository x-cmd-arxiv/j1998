As the O(N)-model\nreduces in the limit N->0 to self-avoiding polymers, the N-colored manifold\nmodel leads to self-avoiding tethered membranes. In the other limit, for inner\ndimension D->1, the manifold model reduces to the O(N)-field theory. We analyze\nthe scaling properties of the model at criticality by a one-loop perturbative\nrenormalization group analysis around an upper critical line. The freedom to\noptimize with respect to the expansion point on this line allows us to obtain\nthe exponent \\nu of standard field theory to much better precision that the\nusual 1-loop calculations. Some other field theoretical techniques, such as the\nlarge N limit and Hartree approximation, can also be applied to this model. By\ncomparison of low and high temperature expansions, we arrive at a conjecture\nfor the nature of droplets dominating the 3d-Ising model at criticality, which\nis satisfied by our numerical results. We can also construct an appropriate\ngeneralization that describes cubic anisotropy, by adding an interaction\nbetween manifolds of the same color. The two parameter space includes a variety\nof new phases and fixed points, some with Ising criticality, enabling us to\nextract a remarkably precise value of 0.6315 for the exponent \\nu in d=3.

By taking a cue from linear response theory we\nrelate the quantum fluctuation in the generator to the generalised\nsusceptibility. Relation between the open-path geometric phase, diagonal\nelements of the quantum metric tensor and the force-force correlation function\nis provided and the classical limit of the fluctuation-correlation theorem is\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 1998 12:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
