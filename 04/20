An invariant structure {\\cal H}^r defined\nas a set of r projection operators is used to induce decomposition of the\ngeometric objects into those of the corresponding subbundles. We define the\nmain geometric objects characterizing decomposition. Invariant non-holonomic\ngeneralizations of the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci's relations have been obtained. All\nthe known types of decomposition (used in the theory of frames of reference, in\nthe Hamiltonian formulation for gravity, in the Cauchy problem, in the theory\nof stationary spaces, and so on) follow from the present work as special cases\nwhen fixing a basis and dimensions of subbundles, and parameterization of a\nbasis of decomposition. Various methods of decomposition have been applied here\nfor the Unified Multidimensional Kaluza-Klein Theory and for relativistic\nconfigurations of a perfect fluid. Discussing an invariant form of the\nequations of motion we have found the invariant equilibrium conditions and\ntheir 3+1 decomposed form. The formulation of the conservation law for the curl\nhas been obtained in the invariant form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 1998 12:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 1998 15:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
