(1)\nElliptical galaxies formed by gas-rich mergers show steep negative metallicity\ngradients of ISM especially in the outer part of galaxies. The essential reason\nfor this is that chemical evolution of ISM in mergers proceeds in such an\ninhomogeneous way that in the central part of mergers, metal-enrichment of ISM\nis more efficient owing to radial inflow of metal-enriched ISM during\ndissipative galaxy merging, whereas in the outer part, metal-enrichment is less\nefficient owing to a larger amount of metal-enriched ISM tidally stripped away\nfrom mergers. This result provides a clue to the origin of gaseous metallicity\ngradients of elliptical halo recently revealed by ASCA. (2) Because of\ninhomogeneous chemical evolution of ISM in mergers, some merger remnants show\nmean gaseous metallicity discernibly smaller than mean stellar one. The degree\nof difference in mean stellar and gaseous metallicity in a merger remnant\ndepends on chemical mixing length, galactic mass, and the effectiveness of\nsupernova feedback. (3) Elliptical galaxies formed by multiple mergers are more\nlikely to have metal-poor gaseous halo components and steep gaseous metallicity\ngradients than those formed by pair mergers. This is principally because a\nlarger amount of less-metal enriched ISM can be tidally stripped away more\nefficiently from galaxies in multiple mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 1998 09:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
