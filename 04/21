The colors\nindicate that the X-ray spectral properties of galaxies vary as a function of\nL_X/L_B. The brightest X-ray galaxies have colors consistent with thermal\nemission from hot gas with roughly the same metallicity of 50% solar. The\nspatial variation of the colors indicates that the gas temperature in these\ngalaxies increases radially. Galaxies with medium L_X/L_B also have spectral\nproperties consistent with emission from hot gas. If a simple one-component\nthermal model is assumed to describe the 0.1-2.0 keV X-ray emission in these\ngalaxies, then one possible explanation for the progressive decrease in L_X/L_B\namong galaxies of this class could be the progressive decrease in metal\nabundance of the X-ray emitting contained by the galaxies. Galaxies with the\nlowest L_X/L_B values appear to be lacking a hot interstellar component. Their\nX-ray colors are consistent with those derived from the bulges of the spiral\ngalaxies M31 and NGC1291. In M31 the X-ray emission is resolved into discrete\nsources, and is apparently due primarily to low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). We\ntherefore suggest that the bulk of the X-ray emission in the faintest\nellipticals is also due to LMXBs. Previously, the X-ray spectra of X-ray faint\ngalaxies had been found to be described by a hard component which was\nattributed to LMXB emission, and a very soft component of unknown origin. We\nshow that the very soft component also likely results from LMXBs, as a very\nsoft component is seen in the X-ray spectra of the nearby LMXB Her X-1 and\nLMXBs in the bulge of M31.

This instability is expected to carry away most of the\nangular momentum of the star by gravitational radiation emission, leaving a\nstar rotating at about 100 Hz. In this paper we model in a simple way the\ndevelopment of the instability and evolution of the neutron star during the\nyear-long spindown phase. This allows us to predict the general features of the\nresulting gravitational waveform. We show that a neutron star formed in the\nVirgo cluster could be detected by the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave\ndetectors when they reach their ``enhanced'' level of sensitivity, with an\namplitude signal-to-noise ratio that could be as large as about 8 if\nnear-optimal data analysis techniques are developed. We also analyze the\nstochastic background of gravitational waves produced by the r-mode radiation\nfrom neutron-star formation throughout the universe. Assuming a substantial\nfraction of neutron stars are born with spin frequencies near their maximum\nvalues, this stochastic background is shown to have an energy density of about\n10^-9 of the cosmological closure density, in the range 20 Hz to 1 kHz.

Other texts took the sun to be halfway to the\nheavens, so this suggests a distance of the sun about 500 earth diameters from\nthe earth. The confirmation for this supposition comes from the later theories\n(c. 500 AD) from the same region and from Greek ideas that speak of roughly the\nsame distance. We suggest that this original conception was transformed by the\nlater Indian and Greek theories in different ways to deal with contradictory\ndata related to outer planet periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 1998 21:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nthis paper we develop appropriate techniques of analysis and visualization of\nsuch imaging data, in order to separate the signal from the noise, as well as\nto characterize the signal. The techniques developed fall into the general\ncategory of multivariate time series analysis, and in particular we extensively\nuse the multitaper framework of spectral analysis. We develop specific\nprotocols for the analysis of fMRI, optical imaging and MEG data, and\nillustrate the techniques by applications to real data sets generated by these\nimaging modalities. In general, the analysis protocols involve two distinct\nstages: `noise' characterization and suppression, and `signal' characterization\nand visualization. An important general conclusion of our study is the utility\nof a frequency-based representation, with short, moving analysis windows to\naccount for non-stationarity in the data. Of particular note are (a) the\ndevelopment of a decomposition technique (`space-frequency singular value\ndecomposition') that is shown to be a useful means of characterizing the image\ndata, and (b) the development of an algorithm, based on multitaper methods, for\nthe removal of approximately periodic physiological artifacts arising from\ncardiac and respiratory sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 1998 21:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-10"}
