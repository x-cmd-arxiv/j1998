In such models, the metal-\nrich GCs are assumed to have formed during the merger process. We explore an\nalternative possibility: that these metal-rich clusters represent the galaxy's\nintrinsic GC population and that the metal-poor component of the observed GC\nmetallicity distribution arises from the capture of GCs from other galaxies,\neither through mergers or through tidal stripping. Starting with plausible\nassumptions for the initial galaxy luminosity function and for the dependence\nof GC metallicity on parent galaxy luminosity, we show that the growth of a\npre-existing seed galaxy through mergers and tidal stripping is accompanied by\nthe capture of metal-poor GCs whose properties are similar to those which are\nobserved to surround giant ellipticals. We describe a method of using the\nobserved number of metal-poor and metal-rich GCs to infer the merger histories\nof individual elliptical galaxies, and use this technique to derive limits on\nthe number of galaxies and total luminosity accreted to date by M49. We argue\nthat although GC specific frequency is conserved in galaxy mergers, the same\nmay not be true of tidal stripping by the mean field of the host galaxy\ncluster. Comparisons of model GC metallicity distributions and specific\nfrequencies to those observed for the well-studied galaxies M49 and M87 show\nthat it is possible to explain their bimodal GC metallicity distributions and\ndiscordant specific frequencies without resorting to the formation of new GCs\nin mergers or by invoking multiple bursts of GC formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 1998 23:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The strong spin frequency dependence of the angular\nmomentum loss rate from gravitational radiation then provides a natural reason\nfor similar spin frequencies. Provided that the interior temperature has a\nlarge scale asymmetry misaligned from the spin axis, then the temperature\nsensitive electron captures in the deep crust can provide the quadrupole needed\nto reach this limiting situation at 300 Hz.

Spin dynamics in the strongly correlated metal are dominated by\nspin fluctuations in the Stoner electron-hole continuum. Furthermore, our\nresults in metallic V_2O_3 represent an unprecedentedly complete\ncharacterization of the spin fluctuations near a metallic quantum critical\npoint, and provide quantitative support for the SCR theory for itinerant\nantiferromagnets in the small moment limit. Dynamic magnetic correlations for\nenergy smaller than k_BT in the paramagnetic insulator carry substantial\nmagnetic spectral weight. However, the correlation length extends only to the\nnearest neighbor distance. The phase transition to the antiferromagnetic\ninsulator introduces a sudden switching of magnetic correlations to a different\nspatial periodicity which indicates a sudden change in the underlying spin\nHamiltonian.
