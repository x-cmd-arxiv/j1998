However, the\nappearance of a central mass, through its effect on the gravitational field in\nthe inner core regions, leads to a \"revitalization\" of ambipolar diffusion in\nthe weakly ionized gas surrounding the central protostar. This process is so\nefficient that it leads to a decoupling of the field from the matter and\nresults in an outward propagating hydromagnetic C-type shock. The existence of\nan ambipolar diffusion-mediated shock was predicted by Li & McKee (1996), and\nwe find that the basic shock structure given by their analytical model is well\nreproduced by our more accurate numerical results.

Recently, the pre-big-bang program was subject to\nattack from on the grounds that pre-big-bang cosmology does not solve the\nhorizon and flatness problems in a ``natural'' way, as customary exponential\n``new'' inflation does. In particular, it appears that an arbitrarily small\ndeviation from perfect flatness in the initial state can not be accommodated.\nFor this analysis, matter in the universe before the big bang was assumed to be\nradiation. We perform a similar analysis to theirs, but using the equation of\nstate for ``string matter'' $\\rho=-3p$ which seems more appropriate to the\nphysical situation and, also, is motivated by the scale factor duality (in the\nflat case) with respect to our expanding, radiation dominated, universe. For an\nopen universe we find, exactly, the same time-dependence of the scale factor as\nin the Milne universe, recently found to represent the universal attractor at\n$t=-\\infty $ of all pre big bang cosmologies. We conclude that our radiation\ndominated universe comes from a flat rather than a curved region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 1998 20:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Because many other functions of\nconformal mapping and potential theory can be expressed in terms of the Bergman\nkernel, our results shed light on the complexity of these objects. We also\nprove that the Bergman kernel is an algebraic function of a single Ahlfors map\nand its derivative. It follows that many objects of potential theory associated\nto a multiply connected domain are algebraic if and only if the domain is a\nfinite branched cover of the unit disc via an algebraic holomorphic mapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 1998 21:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 1998 18:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
