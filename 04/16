This effective temperature and surface gravity are consistent\nwith previous results, but the derived metallicity is lower than that of other\nM13 giants, for which [Fe/H] = -1.60. Using high-resolution synthetic spectra,\nwe determine the photospheric abundances of C, S, and Fe, species unobservable\nin the optical. We find log epsilon(C) = 6.15 +/- 0.10, log epsilon(S) = 5.34\n+/- 0.50, and log epsilon(Fe) = 5.30 (+0.22, -0.26). Again, the Fe abundance is\nlower than expected. This anomaly may reflect selective condensation of metals\nonto dust grains at the end of the AGB phase, as has been suggested for some\ncooler post-AGB stars with peculiar Fe abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 1998 17:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

First, we consider the form of the functions for various\nsimple stellar distributions (binaries, global density profiles, clusters, and\nfractals) and the effects of survey boundaries.\n  Following this, we study the dependencies of the separation at which a\ntransition from the binary to the large-scale clustering regime occurs. Larson\n(1995) found that the mean surface density of companions follows different\npower-law functions of separation in the two regimes. He identified the\ntransition separation with the typical Jeans length in the molecular cloud.\nHowever, we show that this is valid only for special cases. In general, the\ntransition separation depends on the volume density of stars, the depth of the\nstar-forming region, the volume-filling nature of the stellar distribution, and\non the parameters of the binaries. Furthermore, the transition separation\nevolves with time.\n  We then apply these results to the Taurus-Auriga, Ophiuchus, and Orion\nTrapezium star-forming regions. We find that while the transition separation in\nthe Taurus-Auriga star-forming region may indicate a typical Jeans length, this\nis not true of the Orion Trapezium Cluster. We also show that there is no\nevidence for sub-clustering or fractal structure in the stars of the Orion\nTrapezium Cluster.

Using the light-front plane is of crucial importance, while the\nexplicit covariance gives strong advantages emphasized through all the review.\n  The properties of the relativistic few-body wave functions are discussed in\ndetail and are illustrated by examples in a solvable model. The\nthree-dimensional graph technique for the calculation of amplitudes in the\ncovariant light-front perturbation theory is presented.\n  The structure of the electromagnetic amplitudes is studied. We investigate\nthe ambiguities which arise in any approximate light-front calculations, and\nwhich lead to a non-physical dependence of the electromagnetic amplitude on the\norientation of the light-front plane. The elastic and transition form factors\nfree from these ambiguities are found for spin 0, 1/2 and 1 systems.\n  The formalism is applied to the calculation of the relativistic wave\nfunctions of two-nucleon systems (deuteron, scattering state), with particular\nattention to the role of their new components in the deuteron elastic and\nelectrodisintegration form factors and to their connection with meson exchange\ncurrents.
