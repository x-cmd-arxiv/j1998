Radio observations were made using the Very Large Array in\nA-array configuration at 5 and 8 GHz, and using the MERLIN array at 1.4 and\n1.65 GHz. Radio spectral index, radio polarisation, and rotation measure maps\nare presented for both sources. Radio core candidates are detected in each\nsource, and by aligning these with the centroid of the infrared emission the\nradio and the optical/infrared images can be related astrometrically with 0.1\narcsec accuracy. In each source the radio core is located at a minimum of the\noptical emission, probably associated with a central dust lane. Both sources\nalso exhibit radio jets which lie along the directions of the bright strings of\noptical knots seen in high resolution Hubble Space Telescope images. The\nnorthern arm of 3C368 shows a close correlation between the radio and optical\nemission, whilst along the jet direction of 3C324 the bright radio and optical\nknots are co-linear but not co-spatial. These indicate that interactions\nbetween the radio jet and its environment play a key role in producing the\nexcess ultraviolet emission of these sources, but that the detailed mechanisms\nvary from source to source. 3C368 is strongly depolarised and has an average\nrest-frame rotation measure of a few hundred rad/m^2, reaching about 1000\nrad/m^2 close to the most depolarised regions. 3C324 has weaker depolarisation,\nand an average rest-frame rotation measure of between 100 and 200 rad/m^2.

In this framework, the\ngravitational and gauge interactions become united at the weak scale, which we\ntake as the only fundamental short distance scale in nature. The observed\nweakness of gravity on distances $\\gsim$ 1 mm is due to the existence of $n\n\\geq 2$ new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The\nPlanck scale $M_{Pl} \\sim G_N^{-1/2}$ is not a fundamental scale; its enormity\nis simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While\ngravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the\nStandard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of\nweak scale \"thickness\" in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number\nof striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments. For the case of\n$n=2$ new dimensions, planned sub-millimeter measurements of gravity may\nobserve the transition from $1/r^2 \\to 1/r^4$ Newtonian gravitation. For any\nnumber of new dimensions, the LHC and NLC could observe strong quantum\ngravitational interactions. Furthermore, SM particles can be kicked off our 4\ndimensional manifold into the new dimensions, carrying away energy, and leading\nto an abrupt decrease in events with high transverse momentum $p_T \\gsim$ TeV.\nFor certain compact manifolds, such particles will keep circling in the extra\ndimensions, periodically returning, colliding with and depositing energy to our\nfour dimensional vacuum with frequencies of $ \\sim 10^{12}$ Hz or larger.
