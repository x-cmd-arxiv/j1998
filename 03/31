In agreement with previous studies, we find that shock\nvelocities in excess of 10 km s^-1 are required to convert all of the oxygen\nnot locked in CO into H2O before the gas has an opportunity to cool. For pure\ngas-phase models the lifetime of the high water abundances, or ``H2O legacy'',\nin the post-shock gas is 4 - 7 x 10^5 years. Through the Monte Carlo cloud\nsimulation we demonstrate that the time-average abundance of H2O is a sensitive\nfunction of the frequency of shocks. Thus we predict that the abundance of H2O\nand other known outflow tracers can be used to trace the history of shock\nactivity in molecular gas. For gas-grain models we find that the abundance of\nwater-ice on grain surfaces can be quite large and is comparable to that\nobserved in molecular clouds.

In the framework of the linear\ncombination of atomic orbitals method the infinite character of the solid is\nrigorously taken into account. The Hartree-Fock ground-state energy, cohesive\nenergy, lattice constant and bulk modulus are calculated in a fully ab initio\nmanner as it is demonstrated for sodium chloride, NaCl, using basis sets close\nto the Hartree-Fock limit. It is demonstrated that the Hartree-Fock\nband-structure can easily be recovered with the current approach and agrees\nwith the one obtained from a more conventional Bloch-orbital-based calculation.\nIt is argued that the advantage of the present approach lies in its capability\nto include electron correlation effects for crystalline insulators by means of\nwell-established quantum chemical procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 1998 11:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We therefore point out the existence of a new power law\nappearing in physiology. Furhtermore, we show that our experimental result may\nhave a possible explanation within a class of Self-Organized Critical (SOC)\nmodels recently proposed by Boettcher and Paczuski.

A lot of remarkable properties are shared by these\nso-called ``integrable'' equations but they are generically no more valid for\nequations modelising physical phenomema.
