We first calculate\nthe dynamic structure function of a He-3 impurity atom moving in He-3. From\nthat we obtain the excitation spectrum and the momentum dependent effective\nmass. The pole strength of this excitation mode is strongly reduced from the\nfree particle value in agreement with experiments; part of the strength is\ndistributed over high frequency excitations.

The calculations are based on a dynamic theory that uses, as input,\neffective interactions provided by the Fermi hypernetted--chain theory. The\nrelationship between both theories is discussed.
