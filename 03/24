In this model, halos are spherical and form by\nquiescent accretion of matter in clumps, called satellites. The halo mass as a\nfunction of redshift is given by the mass of the most massive progenitor, and\nis determined from Monte-Carlo realizations of the merger-history tree. Inside\nthe halo, satellites move under the action of the gravitational force of the\nhalo and a dynamical friction drag force. The associated equation of motion is\nsolved numerically. The energy lost to dynamical friction is transferred to the\nhalo in the form of kinetic energy. As they sink into the halo, satellites\ncontinually lose matter as a result of tidal stripping. The stripped matter\nmoves inside the halo free of dynamical friction. The evolved density profiles\nare steeper than those obtained by assuming that, once they have been accreted\nonto the parent halo, satellites remain at a fixed distance from the halo\ncenter. We find that the final density profile depends mainly on the rate of\ninfall of matter onto the halo. This, in turn, depends on the initial\nfluctuation field as well as on cosmology. For mass scales where the effective\nspectral index of the initial density field is less than -1, the model predicts\na profile which can only approximately be matched by the one parameter family\nof curves suggested by Navarro, Frenk and White (1997). For scale-free\npower-spectra with initial slope $n$, the density profile within about 1% of\nthe virial radius is $\\rho\\propto r^{-\\beta}$, with $3(3+n)/(5+n)\\le\\beta\\le\n3(3+n)/(4+n)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 1998 14:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Naively, one\nmight expect that the probability of detecting the influence of more than one\nplanet on any single microlensing light curve would be small.

A triad is a\ncomplex of graded $R_A$-modules $(L_1 \\to L_0 \\to L_{-1})$ with certain\nfiniteness hypotheses on its cohomology modules.\n  A pseudo-isomorphism between two triads is a morphism of complexes which\ninduces an isomorphism on the functors $ h_0 (L\\otimes .)$ and a monomorphism\non the functors $h_{-1} (L\\otimes .)$.
