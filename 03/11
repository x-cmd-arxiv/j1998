These moving groups are\nresponsible for the vertex deviation measured even for samples of late-type\nstars; they appear more frequently for ever redder samples; and as a whole they\nfollow an asymmetric-drift relation, in the sense that those only present in\nred samples predominantly have large |v_R| and lag in v_phi w.r.t. the local\nstandard of rest (LSR). The question arise, how these old moving groups got on\ntheir eccentric orbits. A plausible mechanism, known from solar system\ndynamics, which is able to manage a shift in orbit space involves locking into\nan orbital resonance.\n  Apart from these moving groups, there is a smooth background distribution,\nakin to Schwarzschild's ellipsoidal model, with axis ratio of about 1:0.6:0.35\nin v_R, v_phi, and v_z. The contours are aligned with the $v_r$ direction, but\nnot w.r.t. the v_phi and v_z axes: the mean v_z increases for stars rotating\nfaster than the LSR. This effect can be explained by the stellar warp of the\nGalactic disk. If this explanation is correct, the warp's inner edge must not\nbe within the solar circle, while its pattern rotates with frequency of about\n13 km/s/kpc or more retrograde w.r.t. the stellar orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 1998 17:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

Thanks to the signal-to-noise ratio achieved in\nthese observations and to the similarity of the two spectra, we found clear\nevidence of emission features in the low flux region, 1190-1222 A. These\nemission lines can be attributed unambiguously to Fe II and Cr II transitions.\nIn this spectral range, silicon lines are observed in absorption.\n  We built a series of non-LTE model atmospheres with different, prescribed\ntemperature stratification in the upper atmosphere and treating Fe II with\nvarious degrees of sophistication in non-LTE. Emission lines are produced by\nthe combined effect of the Schuster mechanism and radiative interlocking, and\ncan be explained without the presence of a chromosphere. Silicon absorption\nlines and the L alpha profile set constraints on the presence of a\nchromosphere, excluding a strong temperature rise in layers deeper than tau_R ~\n10^{-4}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 1998 12:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The\nmatrix model is the theory on the D-string of type I wrapped on a circle with a\nSO(32) Wilson line on the circle. The radius of the circle depends on the\nWilson line. This is a 1+1 dimensional O(N) theory on a circle. N depends not\nonly on the momentum around the lightlike circle but also on the winding and\nSO(32) quantum numbers of the state. Perspectives for obtaining a matrix model\nfor all Wilson lines are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 1998 02:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
