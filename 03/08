Model fitting of the observed Fe K emission\nline profile makes it possible to estimate a probable inclination angle of the\naccretion disk. In order to study the geometrical relationship between the\naccretion disk and broad emission-line regions (BLRs), we investigate the\ncorrelation between the inclination angle of the accretion disk and the\nvelocity width of BLRs for 18 type-1 Seyfert galaxies. We found that there may\nbe a negative correlation between them, i.e., Seyfert nuclei with a more\nface-on accretion disk tend to have larger BLR velocity widths, suggesting that\nthe BLRs are not coplanar with respect to the accretion disk. The most probable\ninterpretation may be that the BLRs arise from outer parts ({\\it r} $\\sim$ 0.01\npc) of a warped accretion disk illuminated by the central engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 1998 16:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In a flux ratio-to-flux ratio\nplot of EF(6.2)/EF(7.7) as a function of EF(11.3)/EF(7.7), the sample sources\nform roughly a $\\Lambda$-shaped locus which appear to trace, on an overall\nbasis, the hardness of a local heating radiation field. But some driving\nparameters other than the radiation field may also be required for a full\ninterpretation of this trend. On the other hand, the flux ratio of\nEF(8.6)/EF(7.7) shows little variation over the sample sources, except for two\nHII regions which have much higher values for this ratio due to an ``EF(8.6\\um)\nanomaly,'' a phenomenon clearly associated with environments of an intense\nfar-UV radiation field. If further confirmed on a larger database, these trends\nshould provide crucial information on how the EF carriers collectively respond\nto a changing environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 1998 20:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Linear\nextrapolation of its current rate of fading (in magnitude units) puts the time\nof this phase transition within the next 2-4 years. Alternatively, the\nbrightness decline will stop before the nova reaches that level, and the system\nwill continue to show permanent superhumps in its light curve. It will then be\nsimilar to two other old novae, V603 Aql and CP Pup, that still display the\npermanent superhumps phenomenon 79 and 55 years, respectively, after their\neruptions.
