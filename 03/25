The knowledge of the radial gas flows in\nthe galaxy allows us to trace metallicity gradients, and, in particular, the\nformation of a high-metallicity core in ellipticals. The high-metallicity core\nis formed soon enough to explain the metal abundances inferred in high-redshift\nquasars. The star formation rate and the subsequent feedback regulate the\nepisodes of wind, outflow, and cooling flow, thus affecting the recycling of\nthe gas and the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The evolution\nof the galaxy shows several stages, some of which are characterized by a\ncomplex flow pattern, with inflow in some regions and outflow in other regions.\nAll models, however, exhibit during their late evolution a galactic wind at the\nouter boundary and, during their early evolution, an inflow towards the galaxy\nnucleus. The inner inflow evolution could explain the bolometric luminosity of\na quasar lodged at the galaxy centre as well as the evolution of the QSO\nluminosity function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 1998 17:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The resulting picture is that the collective beam dynamics, at\nthe leading semiclassical order in Planck constant can be described by a\nparticular diffusion process, the Nelson process, which is time-reversal\ninvariant. Its diffusion coefficient $\\sqrt{N}\\lambda_{c}$ represents a\nsemiclassical unit of emittance (here $N$ is the number of particles in the\nbeam, and $\\lambda_{c}$ is the Compton wavelength). The stochastic dynamics of\nthe Nelson type can be easily recast in the form of a Schroedinger equation,\nwith the semiclassical unit of emittance replacing Planck constant. Therefore\nwe provide a physical foundation to the several quantum-like models of beam\ndynamics proposed in recent years. We also briefly touch upon applications of\nthe Nelson and Schroedinger formalisms to incorporate the description of\ncollective coherent effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 1998 15:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
