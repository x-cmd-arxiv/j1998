In the last four years, this\nmethod has been applied to a variety of models of condensed matter physics and\nfield theory. With a new generator for the continuous unitary transformation\nproposed in this paper one can avoid some of the problems of former\napplications. General properties of the new generator are derived. It turns out\nthat the new generator is especially useful for Hamiltonians with a banded\nstructure. Two examples, the Lipkin model, and the spin--boson model are\ndiscussed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 1998 10:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
