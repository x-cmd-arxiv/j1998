We find that for binary T Tauri stars closely associated to the\nearly type stars in Upper Scorpius, the youngest subgroup of the OB\nassociation, the peak in the distribution of binary separations is at 90 A.U.\nFor binary T Tauri stars located in the direction of an older subgroup, but not\nclosely associated to early type stars, the peak in the distribution is at 215\nA.U. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that the two binary populations do not\nresult from the same distibution at a significance level of 98%. Apparently,\nthe same physical conditions which facilitate the formation of massive stars\nalso facilitate the formation of closer binaries among low-mass stars, whereas\nphysical conditions unfavorable for the formation of massive stars lead to the\nformation of wider binaries among low-mass stars. The outcome of the binary\nformation process might be related to the internal turbulence and the angular\nmomentum of molecular cloud cores, magnetic field, the initial temperature\nwithin a cloud, or - most likely - a combination of all of these. We conclude\nthat the distribution of binary separations is not a universal quantity, and\nthat the broad distribution of binary separations observed among main-sequence\nstars can be explained by a superposition of more peaked binary distributions\nresulting from various star forming environments. The overall binary frequency\namong pre-main-sequence stars in individual star forming regions is not\nnecessarily higher than among main-sequence stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 1998 17:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
