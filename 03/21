As part of\nthis analysis, we show that measuring the two-meson decay of a photoproduced\n$\\rho$ or $\\phi$ does not determine the vector meson's vector polarization, but\nonly its tensor polarization. The vector meson decay into lepton pairs is also\ninsensitive to the vector meson's vector polarization, unless one measures the\nspin of one of the leptons. Similar results are found for all double spin\nobservables which involve observation of vector meson decay. To access the\nvector meson's vector polarization, one therefore needs to either measure the\nspin of the decay leptons, make an analysis of the background interference\neffects or relate the vector meson's vector polarization to other accessible\nspin observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 1998 21:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We show that in different parameter regimes, the network frequency\ndepends in different ways on the intrinsic and synaptic time constants. Only in\none portion of the parameter space, called `phasic', is the network period\nproportional to the synaptic decay time. These results are discussed in\nconnection with previous work of the authors, which showed that for mildly\nheterogeneous networks, the synchrony breaks down, but coherence is preserved\nmuch more for systems in the phasic regime than in the other regimes. These\nresults imply that for mildly heterogeneous networks, the existence of a\ncoherent rhythm implies a linear dependence of the network period on synaptic\ndecay time, and a much weaker dependence on the drive to the cells.
