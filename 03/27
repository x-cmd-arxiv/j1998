In particular it verifies the selection\nrule that it cannot decay into two fundamental mesons. The $l_{q\\bar q}=1$\nhybrid may decay into two fundamental mesons, but with decay widths larger than\n1 GeV, which tells that they do not really exist as resonant states. Using a\nchromoharmonic potential, we find no mixing between the $l_g=1$ and $l_{c\\bar\nc}=1$.
