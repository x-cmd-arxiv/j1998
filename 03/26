We\nfind that the photo-current can be considered as an up- and down-conversion of\nthe harmonic potentials associated with the displacement currents. As an\nexample explicit calculations are presented for a resonant double barrier\ncoupled to two reservoirs and capacitively coupled to a gate. Two experimental\nsituations are considered: in the first case the ac-field is applied via a\ngate, and in the second case one of the contact potentials is modulated. For\nthe first case we show that the relative weight of the conduction sidebands\nvaries with the screening properties of the system. In contrast to the\nnon-interacting case the relative weights are not determined by Bessel\nfunctions. Moreover, interactions can give rise to an asymmetry between\nabsorption and emission peaks. In the contact driven case, the theory predicts\na zero-bias current proportional to the asymmetry of the double barrier. This\nis in contrast to the discussion of Tien and Gordon which, in violation of\nbasic symmetry principles, predicts a zero-bias current also for a symmetric\ndouble barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 1998 16:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Model-independent upper limits on the production cross-section between\n0.05 and 0.19 pb have been derived for scalar and spin-1/2 particles with\ncharge +/-1. Within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM),\nthis implies a lower limit of 82.5 (83.5) GeV on the mass of long-lived right-\n(left-)handed scalar muons and scalar taus. Long-lived charged leptons and\ncharginos are excluded for masses below 89.5 GeV. For particles with charge\n+/-2/3 the upper limits on the production cross-section vary between 0.05 and\n0.2 pb. All limits, on masses and on cross-sections, are valid at the 95%\nconfidence level for particles with lifetimes longer than 10^{-6} s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 1998 22:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
