This parallel is rigorous in one dimension, if the conserved surface\ncurrent is derivable from a free energy. We study the problem in presence of a\nphysically relevant term breaking the up-down symmetry of the surface and which\ncan not be derived from a free energy. Following the treatment introduced by\nKawasaki and Ohta [Physica 116A, 573 (1982)] for the symmetric case, we are\nable to translate the problem of the surface evolution into a problem of\nnonlinear dynamics of kinks (domain walls). Because of the break of symmetry,\ntwo different classes ($A$ and $B$) of kinks appear and their analytical form\nis derived. The effect of the adding term is to shrink a kink $A$ and to widen\nthe neighbouring kink $B$, in such a way that the product of their widths keeps\nconstant. Concerning the dynamics, this implies that kinks $A$ move much faster\nthan kinks $B$. Since the kink profiles approach exponentially the asymptotical\nvalues, the time dependence of the average distance $L(t)$ between kinks does\nnot change: $L(t)\\sim\\ln t$ in absence of noise, and $L(t)\\sim t^{1/3}$ in\npresence of (shot) noise. However, the cross-over time between the first and\nthe second regime may increase even of some orders of magnitude. Finally, our\nresults show that kinks $A$ may be so narrow that their width is comparable to\nthe lattice constant: in this case, they indeed represent a discontinuity of\nthe surface slope, that is an angular point, and a different approach to\ncoarsening should be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 1998 13:35:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 1998 13:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This background is locally\nanti-de Sitter spacetime with non-vanishing torsion. Conformal invariance is\nexpressed as the torsion being parallelized. The precise effect of the\nconformal invariance on the dynamics of both circular and generic classical\nstrings is extracted. In particular, the conformal invariance gives rise to a\nrepulsive interaction of the string with the background which precisely cancels\nthe dominant attractive term arising from gravity. We perform both\nsemi-classical and canonical string-quantization, in order to see the effect of\nthe conformal invariance of the background on the string mass spectrum. Both\napproaches yield that the high-mass states are governed by m sim HN (N,`large\ninteger'), where m is the string mass and H is the Hubble constant. It follows\nthat the level spacing grows proportionally to N: d(m^2 alpha')/dN sim N, while\nthe entropy goes like: S sim sqrt{m}. Moreover, it follows that there is no\nHagedorn temperature,so that the partition function is well defined at any\npositive temperature. All results are compared with the analogue results in\nAnti- de Sitter spacetime, which is a non conformal invariant background.\nConformal invariance simplifies the mathematics of the problem but the physics\nremains mainly unchanged. Differences between conformal and non-conformal\nbackgrounds only appear in the intermediate region of the string spectrum, but\nthese differences are minor. For low and high masses, the string mass spectra\nin conformal and non-conformal backgrounds are identical.

It thus effectively regularizes\nthe extraction of phase shifts from diverse, incomplete and possibly somewhat\ncontradictory data sets. In doing so, it will provide guidance to\nexperimentalists as to what further measurements should be made. This study is\nlimited to vector spin observables and spin-orbit interactions.
