In this introduction to a\nseries of papers detailing the observable X-ray properties of wind-blown\nbubbles, we describe our method with which we aim to solve this problem,\nanalysing a simulation of a wind-blown bubble around a massive star. We model a\nwind of constant mass and energy injection rate, blowing into a uniform ISM,\nfrom which we calculate X-ray spectra as would be seen by the ROSAT PSPC. We\ncompare the properties of the bubble as would be inferred from the ROSAT data\nwith the true properties of the bubble in the simulation. We find standard\nspectral models yield inferred properties that deviate significantly from the\ntrue properties, even though the spectral fits are statistically acceptable,\nand give no indication that they do not represent to true spectral\ndistribution. Our results suggest that in any case where the true source\nspectrum does not come from a simple single or two temperature distribution the\n\"observed\" X-ray properties cannot naively be used to infer the true\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 1998 16:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Within\nthe framework of the quantized nesting model, we show that the transition\ntemperature is determined by a modified Stoner criterion which includes the\neffect of umklapp scattering. We determine the SDW polarization (linear or\ncircular) by analyzing the Ginzburg-Landau expansion of the free energy. We\nalso study how umklapp processes modify the quantum Hall effect (QHE) and the\nspectrum of the FISDW phases. We find that umklapp scattering stabilizes phases\nwhich exhibit a sign reversal of the QHE, as experimentally observed in the\nBechgaard salts. These ``negative'' phases are characterized by the\nsimultaneous existence of two SDWs with comparable amplitudes. As the umklapp\nscattering strength increases, they may become helicoidal (circularly polarized\nSDWs). The QHE vanishes in the helicoidal phases, but a magnetoelectric effect\nappears. These two characteristic properties may be utilized to detect the\nmagnetic-field-induced helicoidal SDW phases experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 1998 00:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
