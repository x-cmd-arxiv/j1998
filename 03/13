It is shown that this interaction can give a\nlarge contribution to $F_2^v$, especially at large values of $Q^2$. The strong\ndependence of this contribution on the quark masses and $Q^2$ is discussed, and\nit is concluded that a large charm quark contribution to events at high $Q^2$\ncan result from charm pair creation in the instanton field. We also obtain a\nsizeable contribution to the valence quark longitudinal structure function\n$F_L^v$ at high $Q^2$. Experimental observables which can check this instanton\nmechanism in the high $Q^2$ region at HERA are suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 1998 19:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 1998 13:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
