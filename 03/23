For eigenvalues near zero this energy scale shows a\nweak volume dependence that is not consistent with $E_c \\sim 1/L^2$ which might\nbe expected from the pion Compton wavelength and from the behavior of the\nThouless energy in mesoscopic systems. However, the numerical value of $E_c$\nfor our largest volumes is in rough agreement with estimates from the pion\nCompton wavelength. A scaling behaviour consistent with $E_c\\sim 1/L^2$ is\nfound in the bulk of the spectrum. For $\\delta E> E_c$ the number variance\nshows a linear dependence with a slope which is larger than the nonzero\nmultifractality index of the wave functions. Finally, the average spectral\ndensity and the scalar susceptibilities are discussed in the context of\nquenched chiral perturbation theory. We argue that a nonzero value of the\ndisconnected scalar susceptibility requires a linear dependence of the number\nvariance on $\\delta E$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 1998 00:08:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 1998 18:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We investigated\nseveral ``interaction-free'' imaging systems, i.e. systems that allow optical\nimaging of photosensitive objects with less than the classically expected\namount of light being absorbed or scattered by the object. With the most\npromising system, we obtained high-resolution (10 \\mu m), one-dimensional\nprofiles of a variety of objects (human hair, glass and metal wires, cloth\nfibers), by raster scanning each object through the system. We discuss possible\napplications and the present and future limits for interaction-free imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 1998 01:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 1998 21:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It provides an\nunravelling of the evolution of a quantum system coupled to a finite or\ninfinite number of harmonic oscillators, without any approximation. Its power\nis illustrated by several examples, including measurement-like situations,\ndissipation, and quantum Brownian motion. In some examples, we treat the\nenvironment phenomenologically as an infinite reservoir with fluctuations of\narbitrary correlation. In other examples the environment consists of a finite\nnumber of oscillators. In these quasi-periodic cases we see the reversible\ndecay of a `Schroedinger cat' state. Finally, our description of open systems\nis compatible with different positions of the `Heisenberg cut' between system\nand environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 1998 15:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
