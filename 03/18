We define these to be AGN for which the direct line-of-sight to\nthe continuum source is obscured by Compton-thick material. The aim is to\nconstruct, for the first time, a model consistent with X-ray line luminosities,\nline ratios and various luminosity indicators. The ASCA spectra of six such\nsources show several X-ray lines that can be reliably measured, mostly due to\nhighly ionized magnesium, silicon sulphur and iron. These enable us to\ninvestigate the physical conditions of the scattering material. The sources\nshow evidence of He-like and H-like iron lines that are likely to be produced\nin hot (T approx 10^6 K) photoionized gas. By measuring the EW of the lines,\nand by constructing a diagnostic line-ratio diagram, we demonstrate that the\nsilicon and magnesium lines are produced by the same gas emitting the highly\nionized iron lines. The properties of this gas are rather different from the\nproperties of warm absorbers in type I AGN. Neutral 6.4 keV iron lines are also\ndetected, originating in a different component which can be either Compton-thin\nor Compton-thick. The best measured iron lines suggest an enhancement of\nn_{Fe}/n_H by a factor approx 2 compared to solar, in both the hot and cool\nCompton-thin components.

The local Lyapunov time of the flow is\nthe inverse of the finite time Lyapunov exponent. A finite time Lyapunov\nexponent can be expressed in terms of two convergence functions which are\nresponsible for the spatio-temporal complexity of both the advective and\ndiffusive transports.
