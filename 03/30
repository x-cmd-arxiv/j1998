We assess the evidence that these events may be due to a\nseries of bursts from a single source by calculating the probability that such\na clustering in position and in time of occurrence might happen by chance. The\ncalculation of this probability is afflicted by the usual problem of a\nposteriori statistics. We introduce a clustering statistic, which is formed\nfrom the \"minimum circle radius\" (i.e. the radius of the smallest circle that\njust encloses the positions of all the events) and the minimum time lapse (i.e.\nthe time elapsed between the first and last event). We also introduce a second\nclustering statistic, which is formed from the \"cluster likelihood function\"\nand the minimum time lapse. We show that the use of these statistics largely\neliminates the \"a posteriori\" nature of the problem. The two statistics yield\nsignificances of the clustering of $3.3\\times 10^{-4}$ and $3.1\\times 10^{-5}$,\nrespectively, if we interpret the four events as four bursts, whereas the\nclustering is not significant if we interpret the four events as only three\nbursts.

We\nhave observed that its motion looks different from that of a classical top. A\nclassical top rotates about its own axis which precesses around a vertical\nfixed external axis. The hovering magnetic top, on the other hand, has its axis\nslightly tilted and moves rigidly as a whole about the vertical axis. We call\nthis motion synchronous, because in a stroboscopic experiment we see that a\npoint at the rim of the top moves synchronously with the top axis. We show that\nthe synchronous motion may be attributed to a small deviation of the magnetic\nmoment from the symmetry axis of the top. We calculate the minimum angular\nvelocity required for stability in terms of the moments of inertia and magnetic\nfield and show that it is different from that of a classical top. We also give\nexperimental results that were taken with a top whose moment of inertia can be\nchanged.
