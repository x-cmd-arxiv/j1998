A constituent quark model\nHamiltonian with a two-body confinement potential, and residual one-gluon,\none-pion, and one-sigma exchange interactions is used. The complications due to\nthe quark exchange interactions between tetraquark and diquark clusters (Pauli\nprinciple) are taken into account within the framework of the Resonating Group\nMethod. The calculated d' mass is some 350 MeV above the empirical value if the\nsame two-body confinement strength as in the nucleon and Delta is used. This\npaper also examines the validity of the usual assumption of a universal\ntwo-quark confinement strength. We propose that the effective two-body\nconfinement strength in an exotic six-quark system, such as the d', could be\nweaker than in a single baryon. The weaker confinement hypothesis leads to a d'\nmass of M=2092 MeV and a d' radius of r=1.53 fm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 1998 04:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for\nsuch an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain\naspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional\nproblems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise\nbe very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the\nestimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs\nincreases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second\nhalf of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a\ngeneralization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance\nsampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for\nestimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is\nmost attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of\nnormalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful,\nsince its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of\nassessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 1998 19:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 1998 16:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
