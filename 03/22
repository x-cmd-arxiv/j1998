Varga and Cai establish necessary and sufficient\nconditions for a singular M-matrix (without permutation) to allow an LU\nfactorization with L nonsingular. We generalize these results in two\ndirections. First, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of an LU factorization of a singular M-matrix where L and U are both\npermitted to be singular. Second, we establish the minimal block structure that\na block LU factorization of a singular M-matrix can have when L and U are\nM-matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 1998 17:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
