These\nfeatures are thought to provide evidence for the presence of highly collimated\njets in these systems. No similar spectral signatures have been detected in the\nspectra of other short-period CVs.

We then use this relation to\npredict the strength of jet lines in the spectra of ``ordinary'' CVs, i.e.\nsystems characterized by somewhat lower accretion rates than T Pyx. Making the\nassumption that the features seen in T Pyx are indeed jet lines and using this\nsystem as a reference point, we find that if jets are present in many CVs, they\nmay be expected to produce satellite recombination lines with EWs of a few\nhundredths to a few tenths of Angstroms in suitably selected systems.

For a typical halo mass around $10^{11} h^{-1} M_\\odot$ the\nobservations do not discriminate strongly between cosmological models, but if\nthe appropriate mass is larger, say $10^{12} ~h^{-1} M_\\odot$ (which seems\nlikely on theoretical grounds), then the data strongly favour models with a low\nmatter-density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 1998 15:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 1998 14:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We also discuss\nthe possibility of applying these methods for decoherence control in quantum\ninformation processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 1998 15:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
