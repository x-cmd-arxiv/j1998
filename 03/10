However, comparison of the meteoritic and\nphotospheric Li abundances in the Sun indicate that the surface abundance of Li\nin the Sun has been depleted by more than two orders of magnitude.

Observations of Li in\nopen clusters indicate that Li depletion is occurring on the main sequence.\nFurthermore, there is now compelling observational evidence that a spread of\nlithium abundances is present in nearly identical stars.

We confirm an experimental observation that the distance\nd of the point defect from the surface of a water droplet scales with the\nradius r of the droplet like d = 0.3 * r. When the water droplets are moved\napart, we find that the point defect does not stay in the middle between the\ndroplets, but rather forms a dipole with one of them. This confirms a\ntheoretical model for the chaining. Analogies to a second order phase\ntransition are drawn. We also find the dipole when one water droplet is\nsuspended in a bipolar nematic drop with two boojums, i.e., surface defects at\nthe outer boundary.
