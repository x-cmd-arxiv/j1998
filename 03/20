More precisely, we find a first order phase\ntransition (finite mass gap) between wormhole topology and black hole topology;\nthe intermediate membrane being an unstable wormhole collapsing to a black\nhole. Moreover, we find a second order phase transition (no mass gap) between\nMinkowski topology and black hole topology; the intermediate membrane being a\nnaked singularity.\n  For the membranes of black hole topology, we find a mass scaling relation\nanalogous to that originally found by Choptuik. However, in our case the\nparameter $p$ is replaced by a 2-vector $\\vec{p}$ parametrizing the solutions.\nWe find that $Mass\\propto|\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}_*|^\\gamma$ where $\\gamma\\approx\n0.66$. We also find a periodic wiggle in the scaling relation.\n  Our results show that black hole formation as a critical phenomenon is far\nmore general than expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 1998 16:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We\nderive formally simplified sets of equations in a low-speed limit analogous to\nthe zero Mach number limit in combustion theory.\n  When viscosity is neglected and gravity is weak, the simplified system\nincludes: a hyperbolic equation for velocity, a parabolic equation for\ntemperature, an elliptic equation related to volume expansion, an\nintegro-differential equation for mean pressure, and an algebraic equation (the\nequation of state). Solutions are determined by initial values for the mean\npressure, the temperature field, and the divergence-free part of the velocity\nfield. To model multidimensional flows with strong gravity, we offer an\nalternative to the anelastic approximation, one which admits stratified fluids\nin thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as gravity waves but not acoustic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 1998 18:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
