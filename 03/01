We emphasize\nthe criticality of the surface state and the phase coherent transport\nproperties in the thermodynamic limit. A new, stable numerical algorithm for\nlarge scale conductance calculations in the transfer matrix approach is\ndiscussed in detail. It is then applied to a directed network model describing\nthe quantum mechanical tunneling and impurity scattering of the multilayer edge\nstates. We calculate the two-probe conductance in the direction parallel to the\nexternal magnetic field, its fluctuations and statistical distributions as a\nfunction of the interlayer tunneling strength. Using finite size scaling, the\nasymptotic scaling functions of the ensemble averaged conductance and the\nconductance fluctuations are calculated for a fixed aspect ratio and found to\nbe in remarkable agreement with the analytical results obtained using the\nsupersymmetric nonlinear $\\sigma$-model approach. The conductance distribution\nis determined in the quasi-one-dimensional metallic, insulating, as well as the\ncrossover regime where comparisons are made to that at the single-layer quantum\nHall transition. We present, for the first time, a detailed study of the level\nstatistics in the eigenvalue spectrum of the transfer matrix. Coexistence of\nmetallic and insulating statistics is observed in the crossover regime, which\nis attributed to the emergence of a finite range level repulsion in the\ncrossover regime, separating the metallic (Wigner-surmise) behavior at small\nlevel spacings from the insulating (uncorrelated or Poisson) behavior at large\nlevel spacings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 1998 23:57:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 1998 14:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

One enticing alternative to these\napproaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the\nknowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis\ntools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture\ncalled CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used\nto derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a\ndeclarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific\nto a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive\ndomain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative\ntheory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach\nby generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space\nrefinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform\nclassical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP,\nKambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will\ncontrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional\nmethods for customizing domain independent planners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 1998 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
