Due to the broad redshift\ndistribution of galaxies at faint magnitude limits the correlation signal has\nbeen extremely difficult to detect and interpret. We introduce a new technique\nfor measuring the evolution of clustering. We utilize photometric redshifts,\nderived from multicolor surveys, to isolate redshift intervals and calculate\nthe evolution of the amplitude of the angular 2-pt correlation function.\nApplying these techniques to the the Hubble Deep Field we find that the shape\nof the correlation function, at z=1, is consistent with a power law with a\nslope of -0.8. For z>0.4 the best fit to the data is given by a model of\nclustering evolution with a comoving r0 = 2.37 Mpc and eps = -0.4 +/- 0.5,\nconsistent with published measures of the clustering evolution. To match the\ncanonical value of r0 = 5.4 Mpc, found for the clustering of local galaxies,\nrequires a value of eps = 2.10 +/- 0.5 (significantly more than linear\nevolution). The log likelihood of this latter fit is 4.15 less than that for\nthe r0 = 2.37 Mpc model. We, therefore, conclude that the parameterization of\nthe clustering evolution of (1+z)^-(3+eps) is not a particularly good fit to\nthe data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 1998 16:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
