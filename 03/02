The energy\nof created massless particles is calculated as the vacuum contribution in the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the expectation value of the metric. The calculation\nis carried out for an arbitrary quantum field coupled to all external fields\nentering the general second-order equation. The result is obtained as a\nfunctional of the external fields. The paper gives a systematic derivation of\nthis result on the basis of the nonlocal effective action. Although the\nderivation is quite involved and touches on many aspects of the theory, the\nresult itself is remarkably simple. It brings the quantum problem of particle\ncreation to the level of complexity of the classical radiation problem. For\nexternal fields like the electromagnetic or gravitational field there appears a\nquantity, the radiation moment, that governs both the classical radiation of\nwaves and the quantum particle production. The vacuum radiation of an\nelectrically charged source is considered as an example. The research is aimed\nat the problem of backreaction of the vacuum radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 1998 03:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Hayward","title":"Relativistic thermodynamics","comments":"26 pages, plain Tex, presentational changes","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"gr-qc","license":null,"abstract":"  A generally relativistic theory of thermodynamics is developed, based on four\nmain physical principles: heat is a local form of energy, therefore described\nby a thermal energy tensor; conservation of mass, equivalent to conservation of\nheat, or the local first law; entropy is a local current; and non-destruction\nof entropy, or the local second law. A fluid is defined by the thermostatic\nenergy tensor being isotropic. The entropy current is related to the other\nfields by certain equations, including a generalised Gibbs equation for the\nthermostatic entropy, followed by linear and quadratic terms in the dissipative\n(thermal minus thermostatic) energy tensor. Then the second law suggests\ncertain equations for the dissipative energy tensor, generalising the Israel-\nStewart dissipative relations, which describe heat conduction and viscosity\nincluding relativistic effects and relaxation effects. In the thermostatic\ncase, the perfect-fluid model is recovered. In the linear approximation for\nentropy, the Eckart theory is recovered. In the quadratic approximation for\nentropy, the theory is similar to that of Israel & Stewart, but involving\nneither state-space differentials, nor a non-equilibrium Gibbs equation, nor\nnon-material frames. Also, unlike conventional thermodynamics, the thermal\nenergy density is not assumed to be purely thermostatic, though this is derived\nin the linear approximation. Otherwise, the theory reduces in the non-\nrelativistic limit to the extended thermodynamics of irreversible processes due\nto Mueller. The dissipative energy density seems to be a new thermodynamical\nfield, but also exists in relativistic kinetic theory of gases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 1998 05:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 1999 06:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These two properties are crucial for a reliable determination of\nphysical quantities using the Abelian Projection.\n  We also examine a new, Higgs-field-like observable which emerges as a\nby-product of the method.

In this paper we calculate the chargino pair\nproduction cross section at e+e- colliders with quark/squark loop corrections.\nWe introduce a novel formulation, where the one-loop amplitude is reorganized\ninto two parts. One part is expressed in terms of the ``effective'' chargino\ncoupling gbar and mixing matrices U^P, V^P, and includes all O(log m_squark)\ncorrections, while the other decouples for large m_squark. The form of the\none-loop cross section then becomes physically transparent. Our formulation can\nbe easily extended to other loops and processes. Numerically, we find\nsignificant corrections due to the effective t-channel coupling gbar, for\ngaugino-like charginos. In the mixed region, where the chargino has large\ngaugino and Higgsino components, the corrections due to (U^P,V^P) are also\nsignificant. Our numerical results disagree with a previous calculation. We\nrevisit previous studies of the determination of gbar through the measurement\nof the chargino production cross section. We point out that a previous study,\nwhich claimed that the measurement suffers large systematic errors, was\nperformed at a ``pessimistic'' point in MSSM parameter space.
