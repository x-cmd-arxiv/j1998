Given such a\nHopf algebra A, consider its coradical filtration and the associated graded\ncoalgebra grad(A). Then grad(A) is a graded Hopf algebra, since the coradical\nA_0 of A is a Hopf subalgebra. In addition, there is a projection \\pi: grad(A)\n\\to A_0; let R be the algebra of coinvariants of \\pi. Then, by a result of\nRadford and Majid, R is a braided Hopf algebra and grad(A) is the bosonization\n(or biproduct) of R and A_0: grad(A) is isomorphic to (R # A_0). The principle\nwe propose to study A is first to study R, then to transfer the information to\ngrad(A) via bosonization, and finally to lift to A. In this article, we apply\nthis principle to the situation when R is the simplest braided Hopf algebra: a\nquantum linear space. As consequences of our technique, we obtain the\nclassification of pointed Hopf algebras of order p^3 (p an odd prime) over an\nalgebraically closed field of characteristic zero; with the same hypothesis,\nthe characterization of the pointed Hopf algebras whose coradical is abelian\nand has index p or p^2; and an infinite family of pointed, non-isomorphic, Hopf\nalgebras of the same dimension. This last result gives a negative answer to a\nconjecture of I. Kaplansky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 1998 18:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
