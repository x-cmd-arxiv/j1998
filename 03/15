Ages are\ndetermined by means of the magnitude difference between the giant branch clump\nand the turnoff, while metallicities are derived from the location of the giant\nand subgiant branches as compared to fiducial star clusters. We find that in\nmost cases the stellar population of each star cluster is quite similar to that\nof the field where it is embedded. Three particular fields present remarkable\nproperties: (i) The so far unique cluster ESO121-SC03 at ~9 Gyr has a\nsurrounding field which shares the same properties. (ii) The field surrounding\nthe far eastern intermediate age cluster OHSC37 is noteworthy in the sense that\nwe do not detect any evidence of LMC stars. (iii) The fields of SL388 and SL509\npresent CMDs with a secondary clump ~0.45 mag fainter than the dominant\nintermediate age clump, suggesting a stellar population component located\nbehind the LMC disk at a distance comparable to that of the SMC. The mean\nmetallicity derived for the intermediate age outer disk clusters is\n<[Fe/H]>=-0.7 and for their surrounding fields <[Fe/H]>=-0.6. These values are\nsignificantly lower than found by Olszewski et al. (1991, AJ, 101, 515) for a\nsample of clusters of similar age, but are in good agreement with several\nrecent studies. A few clusters stand out in the age--metallicity relation in\nthe sense that they are intermediate age clusters at relatively low metallicity\n([Fe/H]~-1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 1998 17:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We write down\nthe equations of motion for all six degrees of freedom and solve them\nanalytically around the equilibrium solution. Using this solution we then find\nconditions which the height of the hovering top above the base, its total mass,\nand its spinning speed have to satisfy for stable hovering. The calculation\npresented in this paper can be used as a guide to the analysis and synthesis of\nmagnetic traps for neutral particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 1998 12:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
