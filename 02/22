It is shown that the energy balance\nof the electron gas is determined by electron scattering by the piezoelectric\npotential of the acoustic phonons with $T_e$ determined from measurements at\nfrequencies $f$= 30 and 150 MHz. The experimental curves of the energy loss $Q$\nversus $T_e$ at different SAW frequencies depend on the value of $\\omega\n\\bar{\\tau}_{\\epsilon}$, compared to 1, where $ \\bar {\\tau}_{\\epsilon}$ is the\nrelaxation time of the average electron energy. Theoretical calculations of the\nheating of a two-dimensional electron gas by the electric field of the surface\nacoustic wave are presented for the case of thermal electrons ($\\Delta T \\ll\nT$). The calculations show that for the same energy losses $Q$ the degree of\nheating of the two-dimensional electrons (i.e., the ratio $T_e/T$) for $\\omega\n\\bar{\\tau}_{\\epsilon}>1$ ($f$= 150 MHz) is less than for $\\omega\n\\bar{\\tau}_{\\epsilon}<1$ ($f$=30 MHz).

From the $T$ variation of the\nnuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, $^{55}(1/T_1)$ of $^{55}$Mn above the\ncritical pressure of 4 kbar, the spin fluctuation feature is found to change\nbelow a temperature $T_{sf}$. At higher temperature than $T_{sf}$, the nuclear\nrelaxation behavior is well described in terms of the self-consistent\nrenomalized (SCR) spin fluctuation theory for nearly AF metals, whereas below\n$T_{sf}$ a deviation is significant and $1/T_1T$ exhibits a weak $T$ variation.\nIt is pointed out that $T_{sf}$ coincides with the temperature below which a\n$T^{2}$ law in electrical resistivity is valid as expected for a Fermi liquid\nground state. We proposed that these features are understood from the\nstandpoint that the development of AF spin fluctuation remains in short-range\nassociated with the singlet formation among Mn spins in each tetrahedron as\nsuggested by the inelastic neutron experiments on $Y_{1-x}Sc_xMn_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 1998 02:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
