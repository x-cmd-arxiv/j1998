After a short introduction on jets in radio galaxies and radio loud\nquasars the paper focuses on jets in other source types, such as radio-quiet\nquasars, Seyfert and LINER galaxies, and stellar mass black holes. Radio\nobservations of quasars, for example, have brought new evidence for the\nexistence of relativistic jets in radio quiet quasars, while HST and VLA\nobservations of Seyfert galaxies have now clearly established not only the\npresence of radio jets, but also the great importance these jets have for the\nmorphology and the excitation of the emission line region in these AGN.\nMoreover, a recent VLA survey found a large fraction of low-luminosity AGN to\nhost compact, flat-spectrum radio cores indicating the presence of radio jets\nthere as well. Finally the jet/disk-symbiosis model, which successfully\nexplains radio cores in LINER galaxies, is applied to the stellar mass black\nhole GRS 1915+105, indicating that the radio cores in both types of sources are\njust different sides of the same coin. The conclusion drawn from all these\nobservations is that radio jets are a ubiquitous feature of most---if not\nall---AGN and play an important effect in the overall energy budget, as well as\nfor the interpretation of observations in other wavebands (e.g. optical\nemission lines).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 1998 13:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It contains 16 spin components, in contrast to 8 ones\nknown previously, since in a many-body system the parity conservation does not\nreduce the number of the components. The explicitly covariant form of the wave\nfunction automatically takes into account the relativistic spin rotations,\nwithout introducing any Melosh rotation matrices. It also reduces the\ncalculations to the standard routine of the Dirac matrices and of the trace\ntechniques. In examples of the proton magnetic moment and of the axial nucleon\nform factor, with a particular wave function, we reproduce the results of the\nstandard approach. Calculations beyond the standard assumptions give different\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 1998 13:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A pilot project currently\nunder way at LBNL has proven that this platform does indeed provide a viable\nalternative to commercially available file servers at a fraction of the cost\nwithout significant sacrifices in performance and reliability.\n  From a $1,500 worth of hardware, we have built a Solaris x86 file server with\n19.2 GB of disk space, expandable to 112 GB for another $6,200, which has\nproven to be a worthy contender in performance to its proprietary counterparts.\nThe server has not exhibited any software of hardware problems during the four\nmonths it has been in service. Overall, the platform appears to be well suited\nto the needs of an experimental particle physics workgroup. We recommend it for\nuse in the BaBar collaboration.\n  This paper focuses on aspects of building a properly configured dedicated\nfile server that are not adequately covered in the Solaris Installation and\nSystem Administration guides, such as choosing right hardware and performance\noptimization. Parts of it may also be of interest to prospective buyers of IBM\nPC-compatible systems and to Solaris SPARC administrators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 1998 08:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
