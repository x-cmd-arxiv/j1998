The\noptical continuum and broad emission-line regions of 1E 0449.4-1823 may still\nbe partly covered in our line of sight, which would explain its large\nforbidden-line equivalent widths and flat alpha_ox relative to other\nlow-redshift QSOs. Also present are apparent absorption features in the broad\nBalmer lines and in Mg II, which may be related to the past obscuration and\ncurrent emergence of the broad-line region. However, it is difficult to\ndistinguish absorption from broad emission-line peaks that are displaced in\nvelocity; we consider the latter a plausible competing interpretation of these\npeculiar line profiles.

Power density spectra of observations\nmade with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer show significant sidebands separated\nfrom the pulsar spin frequency (and its harmonics) by the QPO frequency.

We find that the densities take\na distinctive ``source-propagator'' form. This form does not arise in a\nconventional derivation of the semiclassical transport equations because of the\noveruse of the gradient approximation. We do not apply the gradient\napproximation and so derive the phase-space analog of the Generalized\nFluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Together, this theorem and the expression for\nthe phase-space particle self-energies give a set of coupled phase-space\nevolution equations. We illustrate how these evolution equations can be used\nperturbatively or to derive semiclassical transport equations. Our work relies\non phase-space propagators and sources, so we describe them in detail when\ncalculating the photon and electron phase-space densities.
