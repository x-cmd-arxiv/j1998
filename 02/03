The simplest LAEMW approach predicts a slower\ndecay in observed afterglow peak frequency and faster decay in flux than the\nsimplest blast-wave model, though more complicated models of both can provide\ndifferent dependences. LAEMW do not require the rapid magnetic field\namplification demanded of the blast-wave approach because the emission\noriginates from a nearly fixed radius. Different time dependent behavior of GRB\nand post-GRB emission is also predicted.

The luminosity function shows increasing numbers of blue\nclusters to the limit of our photometry, which reaches several magnitudes past\nthe turnover predicted if the cluster population were identical to current\nGalactic globulars seen at a younger age.

These kinematics -- usually\nparameterized by the Oort constants A and B -- depend on the local gradient of\nthe rotation curve as well as its absolute value (Theta_0), and the Sun's\ndistance to the Galactic center (R_0). The density of interstellar gas in the\nMilky Way is shown to vary non-monotonically with radius, and so contributes\nsignificantly to the local gradient of the rotation curve. We have therefore\ncalculated mass models for the Milky Way that include this component, and have\nderived the corresponding radial variation in the Oort constants. Between\n0.9R_0 and 1.2R_0, the Oort functions, A(R) and B(R), differ significantly from\nthe general Theta/R dependence. Various previously-inexplicable observations\nare shown to be consistent with these predictions. These models can explain the\n40% difference between the values for 2 A R_0 derived from radial velocity data\noriginating in the inner and outer Galaxy. They also go some way toward\nexplaining the different shapes of the velocity ellipsoids of giant and dwarf\nstars in the solar neighbourhood. However, a consistent picture only emerges if\none adopts small values of R_0 = 7.1 +/- 0.4 kpc and Theta_0 = 184 +/- 8 km/s.\nWith these Galactic constants, the Milky Way's rotation curve declines slowly\nin the outer Galaxy; V_rot(20 kpc) = 166 kms. Our low value for R_0 agrees well\nwith the only direct determination (7.2 +/- 0.7 kpc, Reid 1993). Using these\nGalactic constants, we find that the proper motion of Sgr A^* is consistent\nwith the observational constraints.

We find that the resulting gas flows are strongly decoupled: an inflow\ndevelops in the central region of the galaxies, while the external parts are\nstill degassing, i.e., the flows are mostly partial winds. This behavior can be\nexplained in terms of the local energy balance of the hot gas. A large spread\nin the X-ray luminosity Lx at fixed optical luminosity Lb can be produced as in\nprevious simulations that used King models plus massive quasi-isothermal dark\nhalos, and higher supernova rates; the key factor causing large Lx variations\nis now the size of the central inflow region.

Some\nexamples of such ambiguity are presented for a particularly simple model and\nsome known modifications. However, we point out that there exist a class of\nnonlinear modifications of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation where this difference\ndoes not occur, which makes them more consistent in a manner similar to that of\nthe linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. It is found that necessary but not\nsufficient a condition for such modifications is the homogeneity of the\nmodified Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation or its underlying Lagrangian density which is\nassumed to be ``bilinear'' in the wave function in some rather general sense.\nYet, it is only for a particular form of this density that the ambiguity in\nquestion does not arise.
