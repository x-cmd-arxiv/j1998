Although the recycling model\nreproduces the basic X-ray observables, it appears to be unstable with respect\nto the development of inflow or outflow. In spherically symmetry the inflows\nare subject to a central cooling catastrophe, while the outflows saturate in a\nform of a subsonic galactic wind. Two-dimensional axisymmetric random velocity\nperturbations of the equilibrium model trigger the onset of a cooling\ncatastrophe, which develops in an essentially non-spherical way.

We discuss Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) which was first\nintroduced by Maskawa and Yamawaki (MY). Following MY, we present canonical\nformalism of DLCQ and the zero-mode constraint through which the zero mode can\nactually be solved away in terms of other modes,thus establishing the trivial\nvacuum. Due to this trivial vacuum, existence of the massless Nambu-Goldstone\n(NG) boson coupled to the current is guaranteed by the non-conserved charge\nsuch that Q |0> = 0 and dot{Q} ne 0. The SSB (NG phase) in DLCQ can be realized\non the trivial vacuum only when an explicit symmetry-breaking mass of the NG\nboson m_{pi} is introduced so that the NG-boson zero mode integrated over the\nLF exhibits singular behavior sim 1/m_{pi}^2 in such a way that dot{Q} ne 0 in\nthe symmetric limit m_{pi} -> 0. We also demonstrate this realization more\nexplicitly in the linear sigma model where the role of zero-mode constraint is\nclarified. We fur ther point out, in disagreement with Wilson et al., that for\nSSB in the continuum LF theory, the trivial vacuum collapses due to the special\nnature of the zero mode as the accumulating point P^+ -> 0, in sharp contrast\nto DLCQ. Finally, we discuss the no-go theorem of Nakanishi and Yamawaki, which\nforbids exact LF r estriction of the field theory. Thus DLCQ as well as any\nother regularization on the exact LF has no Lorentz-invariant limit as the\ntheory itself, although the Lorentz-invariant limit can be realized on the\nc-number quantity like S matrix which has no reference to the fixed LF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 1998 16:48:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 1998 14:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This is a ringed space (M,O) where O is a certain sheaf of\nnoncommutative rings on M. Such ringed spaces can be glued together to form\nmore global objects called NC-schemes. We are especially interested in\nNC-manifolds, NC-schemes for which the completion of O at every point of M is\nisomorphic to the algebra of noncommutative power series (completion of the\nfree associative algebra). An explicit description of the simplest NC-manifold,\nthe affine space, is given by using the Feynman-Maslov calculus of ordered\noperators. We show that many familiar algebraic varieties can be naturally\nenlarged to NC-manifolds. Among these are all the classical flag varieties and\nall the smooth moduli spaces of vector bundles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 1998 00:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Traditionally in industry design engineers have employed Engineering\nData Management Systems (also called Product Data Management Systems) to\ncoordinate and control access to documented versions of product designs.\nHowever, these systems provide control only at the collaborative design level\nand are seldom used beyond design.

Commercial workflow\nproducts cannot support the highly dynamic activities found both in the design\nstages of product development and in rapidly evolving workflow definitions.
