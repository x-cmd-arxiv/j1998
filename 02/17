In particular, the IMF is\npredicted to flatten with increasing local luminosity density, with the\nformation of massive stars being preferentially enhanced in brighter regions.\nIf IMF gradients are general features of galaxies, several previous\nastrophysical measurements, such as the surface mass densities of spirals\n(obtained assuming constant mass to light ratios), were plagued by substantial\nsystematic errors. In this Letter, calculations which account for possible IMF\ngradients are presented of surface densities of spiral galaxies. Compared to\nprevious estimates, the mass densities corrected for IMF gradients are higher\nin the outer regions of the disks. For a model based on the Milky Way but with\nan IMF scaled according to R136, the rotation curve without the traditional\ndark halo component falls with Galactocentric radius, though slower than it\nwould without IMF gradients. For a second model of the Milky Way in which the\nIMF gradient is increased by 50%, the rotation curve is approximately flat in\nthe outer disk, with a rotational velocity below ~220 km/s only before the\ntraditional dark halo component is added. These results, if generalizable to\nother galaxies, not only call into question the assertion that dark matter\nhalos are compatible with the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies, but also\nmay clarify our understanding of a wide variety of other astrophysical\nphenomena such as the G-dwarf problem, metallicity gradients, and the\nTully-Fisher relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 1998 20:06:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 1998 22:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

An inflationary phase does not affect this string bound if the\nreheat temperature is high T_reh > f_a or, conversely, for T_reh < f_a, if the\nHubble parameter during inflation is large H_1 > f_a; in both cases, strings\nform and we return to the standard picture with a m_a ~ 100 microeV dark matter\naxion.

Preliminary analysis of the momentum flux of the classical\nzero-point radiation impinging on accelerated objects as viewed by an inertial\nobserver suggests that the resistance to acceleration attributed to inertia may\nbe at least in part a force of opposition originating in the vacuum. This\nanalysis avoids the ad hoc modeling of particle-field interaction dynamics used\npreviously to derive a similar result. This present approach is not dependent\nupon what happens at the particle point, but on how an external observer\nassesses the kinematical characteristics of the zero-point radiation impinging\non the accelerated object. A relativistic form of the equation of motion\nresults from the present analysis. Its covariant form yields a simple result\nthat may be interpreted as a contribution to inertial mass. Our approach is\nrelated by the principle of equivalence to Sakharov's conjecture of a\nconnection between Einstein action and the vacuum. The argument presented may\nthus be construed as a descendant of Sakharov's conjecture by which we attempt\nto attribute a mass-giving property to the electromagnetic component -- and\npossibly other components-- of the vacuum. In this view the physical momentum\nof an object is related to the radiative momentum flux of the vacuum\ninstantaneously contained in the characteristic proper volume of the object.\nThe interaction process between the accelerated object and the vacuum (akin to\nabsorption or scattering of electromagnetic radiation) appears to generate a\nphysical resistance (reaction force) to acceleration suggestive of what has\nbeen historically known as inertia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 1998 01:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
