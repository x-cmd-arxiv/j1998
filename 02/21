For\nexample, if p of the complementary components are not Seifert fibered, then p <\ng. This result generalizes work of Kobayashi. The Heegaard genus g also puts\nexplicit bounds on the complexity of the Seifert pieces. For example, if the\nunion of the base spaces of the Seifert pieces has Euler characteristic X and\nthere are a total of f exceptional fibers in the Seifert pieces, then f - X is\nno greater than 3g - 3 - p.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 1998 20:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find that a few inelastic processes are sufficient to damp the\nrevivals of the phase. For this reason the observability of phase revivals for\npresent experimental conditions is limited to condensates with a few hundreds\nof atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 1998 19:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
