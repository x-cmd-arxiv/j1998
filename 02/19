The traditional\nview is that the most massive galaxies were assembled early and have evolved\nwith steeply declining star formation rates since a redshift of 2 or higher.\nAccording to hierarchical theories, massive galaxies were assembled much more\nrecently from mergers of smaller subunits. Here we present a simple\nobservational test designed to differentiate between the two. The observed\nK-band flux from a galaxy is a good measure of its stellar mass even at high\nredshift. It is probably only weakly affected by dust extinction. We compute\nthe evolution of the observed K-band luminosity function for traditional, pure\nluminosity evolution (PLE) models and for hierarchical models. At z=0, both\nmodels can fit the observed local K-band luminosity function. By redshift 1,\nthey differ greatly in the predicted abundance of bright galaxies. We calculate\nthe redshift distributions of K-band selected galaxies and compare these with\navailable data. We show that the number of K<19 galaxies with redshifts greater\nthan 1 is well below the numbers predicted by the PLE models. In the Songaila\net al (1994) redshift sample of 118 galaxies with 16<K<18, 33 galaxies are\npredicted to lie at z>1. Only 2 are observed. In the Cowie et al.

Both these samples are more than 90% complete.\nWe conclude that there is already strong evidence that the abundance of massive\ngalaxies at z=1 is well below the local value. This is inconsistent with the\ntraditional model, but similar to the expectations of hierarchical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 1998 20:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We focus on the factors that determine the\nlevel of synchrony and frequency of the network response, as well as the\neffects of mild heterogeneity on network dynamics. With mild heterogeneity,\nsynchrony is never perfect and is relatively fragile. In addition, the effects\nof inhibition are more complex in mildly heterogeneous networks than in\nhomogeneous ones. In the former, synchrony is broken in two distinct ways,\ndepending on the ratio of the synaptic decay time to the period of repetitive\naction potentials ($\\tau_s/T$), where $T$ can be determined either from the\nnetwork or from a single, self-inhibiting neuron. With $\\tau_s/T > 2$,\ncorresponding to large applied current, small synaptic strength or large\nsynaptic decay time, the effects of inhibition are largely tonic and\nheterogeneous neurons spike relatively independently. With $\\tau_s/T < 1$,\nsynchrony breaks when faster cells begin to suppress their less excitable\nneighbors; cells that fire remain nearly synchronous. We show numerically that\nthe behavior of mildly heterogeneous networks can be related to the behavior of\nsingle, self-inhibiting cells, which can be studied analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 1998 16:36:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
