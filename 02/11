Observing that density structures tend\nto form in a hierarchical manner, we assume that density fluctuations follow a\nrandom multiplicative process. When the polytropic exponent $\\gamma$ is equal\nto unity, the local Mach number is independent of the density, and our\nassumption leads us to expect that the probability density function (PDF) of\nthe density field is a lognormal. This isothermal case is found to be singular,\nwith a dispersion $\\sigma_s^2$ which scales like the square turbulent Mach\nnumber $\\tilde M^2$, where $s\\equiv \\ln \\rho$ and $\\rho$ is the fluid density.\nThis leads to much higher fluctuations than those due to shock jump relations.\n  Extrapolating the model to the case $\\gamma \\not =1$, we find that, as the\nMach number becomes large, the density PDF is expected to asymptotically\napproach a power-law regime, at high densities when $\\gamma<1$, and at low\ndensities when $\\gamma>1$. This effect can be traced back to the fact that the\npressure term in the momentum equation varies exponentially with $s$, thus\nopposing the growth of fluctuations on one side of the PDF, while being\nnegligible on the other side. This also causes the dispersion $\\sigma_s^2$ to\ngrow more slowly than $\\tilde M^2$ when $\\gamma\\not=1$.
