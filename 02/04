The heat kernels and/or zeta-functions for the\nvarious spins are related to that of a non-minimally coupled one. A WKB\napproximation is used in obtaining the radial part of that heat kernel. The\nsimulations of the resulting equations of motion seem to exclude the\npossibility of a closed universe, $K=+1$, as these turn out to have an\noverwhelming tendency towards a fast collapse - the details such as the rate of\nthis collapse depends on the structure of the underlying quantum degrees of\nfreedom: a non-minimal coupling to curvature accelerates the process.

Since the plateau condition for\nthe smoothed single-particle energy seldom holds, a new recipe is suggested for\nthe definition of the shell correction. The generalized Strutinsky smoothing\nprocedure is compared with the results of the semi-classical Wigner-Kirkwood\nexpansion. A good agreement has been found for weakly bound nuclei in the\nvicinity of the proton drip line. However, some deviations remain for extremely\nneutron-rich systems due to the pathological behavior of the semi-classical\nlevel density around the particle threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 1998 15:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
