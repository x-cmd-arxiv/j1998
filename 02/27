The brightness of the optical source increased\nfrom Rc=21.19 (May 9.75 UT) to Rc=19.70 (May 10.77 UT), whereupon it was\ndecaying in all the four BVRcIc bands during about one month after the burst.\nBetween the 3rd and the 6th night after the GRB970508 event, the flux decrease\nof the optical source follows an exponential law in all the four bands. In that\nperiod the broad-band spectrum of the object does not change and can be\napproximately described by a power with index -1.1. The subsequent observations\nshowed a reduction of the source brightness decrease rate in all bands. The\nsource flux decay after the maximum in the Rc band is well described by a\nsingle power-law with index -1.171 for the whole set of observations during 86\ndays. In the other bands the decay seems to slow down from the 31th day\nonwards. In particular, in the Ic band the source magnitude is about 23.1 from\nthe 36th day after the GRB to the end of the observations (August 4, 1997).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 1998 16:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The most accurate determinations are in the energy-dependent\npartial-wave analyses of the NN data. The recommended value is f^2 = 0.075 . A\nrecent determination of f^2 by the Uppsala group from backward np cross\nsections is shown to be model dependent and inaccurate, and therefore\ncompletely uninteresting. We also argue that an accurate determination of f^2\nusing pp forward dispersion relations is not a realistic option.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 1998 15:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}

A quantum robot is a mobile quantum\nsystem that includes a quantum computer and needed ancillary systems on board.\nQuantum robots carry out tasks whose goals include specified changes in the\nstate of the environment or carrying out measurements on the environment. Each\ntask is a sequence of alternating computation and action phases. Computation\nphase activities include determination of the action to be carried out in the\nnext phase and possible recording of information on neighborhood environmental\nsystem states. Action phase activities include motion of the quantum robot and\nchanges of neighborhood environment system states. Models of quantum robots and\ntheir interactions with environments are described using discrete space and\ntime. To each task is associated a unitary step operator T that gives the\nsingle time step dynamics. T = T_{a}+T_{c} is a sum of action phase and\ncomputation phase step operators. Conditions that T_{a} and T_{c} should\nsatisfy are given along with a description of the evolution as a sum over paths\nof completed phase input and output states. A simple example of a task carrying\nout a measurement on a very simple environment is analyzed. A decision tree for\nthe task is presented and discussed in terms of sums over phase paths. One sees\nthat no definite times or durations are associated with the phase steps in the\ntree and that the tree describes the successive phase steps in each path in the\nsum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 1998 19:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 1998 21:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-30"}
