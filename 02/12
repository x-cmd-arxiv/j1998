The strategy is to determine the scale $r_c$ at\nwhich the dissipation rate is the largest in a given turn-over time series.\nThis specific scale $r_c$ translates into a specific ``phase'' in the logarithm\nof the scale which, when used as the origin, allows one to phase up the\ndifferent measurements of a structure factor $S_p(r) = A_p (\\bar\\epsilon\nr)^{p/3}$ in different turn-over time realizations.

It is analogue associative memory and a formal\nneural network. A particularity of the models is combination of continuous\ninternal processes with discrete set of output states. The modeling of the\nsystem by classical analogue computers was offered long times ago, but now it\nis not very effectively in comparison with modern digital computers. The\napplication of quantum analogue modelling looks quite possible for modern level\nof technology and it may be more effective than digital one, because number of\nelement may be about Avogadro number (N=6.0E23).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 1998 16:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We elucidate the connection of the classical propagator to the\nquantum propagator for the density matrix and to the Green's function of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Within the new description of quantum mechanics we give\na definition of coherence solely in terms of properties of the MDF and we test\nthe new definition recovering well known results. As an application, the forced\nparametric oscillator is considered .
