Applying the dynamics to cell differentiation, isologous\ndiversification theory is proposed. According to it, orbital instability leads\nto diversified cell behaviors first. At the next stage, several cell types are\nformed, first triggered by clustering of oscillations, and then as attracting\nstates of internal dynamics stabilized by the cell-to-cell interaction. At the\nthird stage, the differentiation is determined as a recursive state by cell\ndivision. At the last stage, hierarchical differentiation proceeds, with the\nemergence of stochastic rule for the differentiation to sub-groups, where\nregulation of the probability for the differentiation provides the diversity\nand stability of cell society.

Recent sub-millimetre continuum studies show that the host\ngalaxies of many luminous high-redshift AGN (radio galaxies and radio-quiet\nquasars) radiate strongly at rest-frame far-infrared wavelengths and thus\ncontain substantial quantities of dust. In the majority of these high-redshift\nAGN-hosts, the inferred star formation is proceeding at a rate comparable to\nthat found in local, interacting ultra-luminous FIR galaxies.

This dark halo\nis treated as the core region of a King distribution of dark matter particles,\nin consistency with the observational result of dwarf galaxies having solid\nbody rotation curves. Thus we derive a simple formula which provides a reliable\nand general first order solution to the problem, totally analogous to the one\ncorresponding to the dynamical friction problem in an isothermal halo. This\nanalytic approach allows a clear handling and a transparent understanding of\nthe physics and the scaling of the problem. A comparison with the isothermal\ncase shows that in the core regions of a King sphere, dynamical friction\nproceeds at a different rate, and is sensitive to the total core radius. Thus,\nin principle, observable consequences may result. In order to illustrate the\npossible effects, we apply this formula to the spiraling of globular cluster\norbits in dwarf galaxies, and show how present day globular cluster systems\ncould in principle be used to derive better limits on the structure of dark\nhalos around dwarf galaxies, when the observational situation improves. As a\nsecond application, we study the way a massive black hole population forming a\nfraction of these dark halos would gradually concentrate towards the centre,\nwith the consequent deformation of an originally solid body rotation curve.\nThis effect allows us to set limits on the fraction/mass of any massive black\nhole minority component of the dark halos of dwarf galaxies.

This process of\nlinearization leads naturally to two fundamental structures: the generalized\nClifford algebra (GCA) and the generalized Grassmann algebra (GGA) which are\nstudied. Then, it is proved that if we equip the GGA with a differential\nstructure, we obtain the $q-$deformed Heisenberg algebra or the\n$q-$oscillators. Finally, it is shown that the $q-$deformed Heisenberg algebra\nis the basic tool to define an adapted superspace leading to the extension of\nsupersymmetry called fractional supersymmetry of order $F$ (FSUSY), $F=2$\ncorresponding to the usual supersymmetry. Local FSUSY in one dimension is then\ncontructed in the world-line formalism, and an extension of the Dirac equation\nis obtained. In two dimensions, it turns out that FSUSY is a conformal field\ntheory and in addition to the stress energy tensor, a supercurrent of conformal\nweight $1+1/F$, which generates a symmetry between the primary fields of\nconformal weight $(0,1, \\cdots, 1-1/F$), is obtained. The algebra is explicitly\nconstructed. We also show that in $1+2$ dimensions FSUSY is a non-trivial\nextension of the Poincar\\'e algebra which generates a symmetry among fractional\nspin states or anyons. Unitarity of the representation is checked. Finally, we\nprove that, independently of the dimension, a natural classification emerges\naccording to the decomposition of $F$ as a product of prime numbers and that\nFSUSY is a symmetry which closes non-linearly, and is sustained by mathematical\nstructures that go beyond Lie or super-Lie algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 1998 10:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
