There are serious\nproblems with doing so. If one reverses the sign of the action of both the\ninstanton and the fluctuations, the latter are unsupressed and the calculation\nbecomes meaningless. So for a sensible result one would have to reverse the\nsign of the action for the background, while leaving the sign for the\nperturbations fixed by the usual Wick rotation. The problem with this approach\nis that there is no invariant way to split a given four geometry into\nbackground plus perturbations. So the prescription would have to violate\ngeneral coordinate invariance. There are other indications that a sign change\nis problematic. With the choice $P \\sim e^{+S}$ the nucleation of primordial\nblack holes during inflation is unsuppressed, with a disastrous resulting\ncosmology.

This difference leads to a greater efficiency of\nquantum computation over its classical counter-part. In this review we explain\nthe basic principles of quantum computation, including the construction of\nbasic gates, and networks. We illustrate the power of quantum algorithms using\nthe simple problem of Deutsch, and explain, again in very simple terms, the\nwell known algorithm of Shor for factorisation of large numbers into primes. We\nthen describe physical implementations of quantum computers, focusing on one in\nparticular, the linear ion-trap realization. We explain that the main obstacle\nto building an actual quantum computer is the problem of decoherence, which we\nshow may be circumvented using the methods of quantum error correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 1998 17:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}
