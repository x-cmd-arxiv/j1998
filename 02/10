For a graph X, an abelian group B, and a nonnegative integer j,\nan element of Hom(K^j(X),B) is a coherent family of B-valued flows on the set\nof all graphs obtained by contracting some (j-1)-set of edges of X; in\nparticular, Hom(K^1(X),R) is the familiar (real) ``cycle-space'' of X. We show\nthat K(X) is torsion-free and that its Poincare polynomial is the\nspecialization t^{n-k}T_X(1/t,1+t) of the Tutte polynomial of X (here X has n\nvertices and k components). Functoriality of K induces a functorial coalgebra\nstructure on K(X); dualizing, for any ring B we obtain a functorial B-algebra\nstructure on Hom(K(X),B). When B is commutative we present this algebra as a\nquotient of a divided power algebra, leading to some interesting inequalities\non the coefficients of the above Poincare polynomial. We also provide a formula\nfor the theta function of the lattice of integer-valued flows in X, and\nconclude with ten open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 1998 18:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
