Recently\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis published an all-sky reddening map based on the\nCOBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA infrared sky surveys. Their map is intended to\nsupersede the older Burstein & Heiles reddening estimates. In this paper I test\nthis new reddening map by comparing the reddening values for a sample of 110\n$|b|>5\\deg$ Galactic globular clusters selected from compilation of Harris. I\nfind a good agreement for globular clusters with galactic latitude $|b|>20\\deg$\nand fair overall agreement for globular clusters with $20>|b|>5\\deg$, but with\nseveral significant deviations. I discuss four individual clusters with largest\ndeviations, NGC 6144, Terzan 3, NGC 6355 and IC 1276, in order to investigate\nthe reasons for these large deviations. It seems that the new reddening map\noverestimates the reddening in some large extinction regions.
