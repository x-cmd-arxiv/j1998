In our scenario, a highly evolved central core in the dense galactic\nnucleus is formed containing a subsystem of compact stellar remnants (CSRs),\nsuch as neutron stars and black holes. Those subsystems result from the\ndynamical evolution of dense central stellar clusters in the galactic nuclei\nthrough merging of stars, thereby forming (as has been realized by many\nauthors) the short-living massive stars and then CSRs. We estimate the rate of\nrandom CSR collisions in the evolved galactic nuclei by taking into account,\nsimilar to Quinlan & Shapiro (1987), the dissipative encounters of CSRs, mainly\ndue to radiative losses of gravitational waves, which results in the formation\nof intermediate short-living binaries, with further coalescence of the\ncompanions to produce GRBs. We also consider how the possible presence of a\ncentral supermassive black hole, formed in a highly evolved galactic nucleus,\ninfluences the CSR binary formation. This scenario does not postulate ad hoc a\nrequired number of tight binary neutron stars in the galaxies. Instead, it\ngives, for the most realistic parameters of the evolved nuclei, the expected\nrate of GRBs consistent with the observed one, thereby explaining the GRB\nappearance in a natural way of the dynamical evolution of galactic nuclei.
