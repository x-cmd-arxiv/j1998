We use an effective Lagrangian, which\nincorporates the effect of the neutrons on the neutrinos. Following Schwinger,\nit is shown that the total interaction energy density is computed by comparing\nthe zero point energy of the neutrino sea with and without the star. It has\nalready been shown that in an infinite-size star the total energy due to\nneutrino exchange vanishes exactly. The opposite claim that massless neutrino\nexchange would produce a huge energy is due to an improper summation of an\ninfrared-divergent quantity. The same vanishing of the total energy has been\nproved exactly in the case of a finite star in a one-dimensional toy model.\n  Here we study the three-dimensional case. We first consider the effect of a\nsharp star border, assumed to be a plane. We find that there is a non-\nvanishing of the zero point energy density difference between the inside and\nthe outside due to the refraction index at the border and the consequent\nnon-penetrating waves. An analytical and numerical calculation for the case of\na spherical star with a sharp border confirms that the preceding border effect\nis the dominant one. The total result is shown to be infrared-safe, thus\nconfirming that there is no need to assume a neutrino mass. The ultraviolet\ncut-offs, which correspond in some sense to the matching of the effective\ntheory with the exact one, are discussed.
