From this combined catalog we generate the\nmorphological galaxy number-counts and corresponding redshift distributions and\ncompare these to the predictions of high normalization zero- and passive-\nevolution models. From this comparison we conclude the following: (1) E/S0s are\nseen in numbers and over a redshift range consistent with zero- or minimal\npassive- evolution to I = 24. Beyond this limit fewer E/S0s are observed than\npredicted implying a net negative evolutionary process --- luminosity dimming,\ndisassembly or masking by dust --- at I > 24. (2) Spiral galaxies are present\nin numbers consistent with zero- evolution predictions to I = 22. Beyond this\nmagnitude some net- positive evolution is required. Although the number-counts\nare consistent with the passive-evolution predictions to I=26.0 the redshift\ndistributions favor number AND luminosity evolution. (3) There is no obvious\nexplanation for the late-type/irregular class and this category requires\nfurther subdivision. While a small fraction of the population lies at low\nredshift (i.e. true irregulars), the majority lie at redshifts, 1 < z < 3. At z\n> 1.5 mergers are frequent and, taken in conjunction with the absence of normal\nspirals at z > 2, the logical inference is that they represent the progenitors\nof normal spirals forming via hierarchical merging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 1998 09:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
