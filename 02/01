We have been\nable to improve significantly on previous studies by carefully choosing pairs\nof well matched reddened and unreddened stars. In addition, we benefited from\nthe improved S/N of the NEWSIPS IUE data and the larger sample of SMC stars now\navailable. Searching the IUE Final Archive, we found only four suitable\nearly-type stars that were significantly reddened and had well matched\ncomparison stars. The extinction for three of these stars is remarkably\nsimilar. The curves are roughly linear with 1/lambda and have no measurable\n2175 A bump. The fourth star has an extinction curve with a significant 2175 A\nbump and weaker far-UV extinction. The dust along all four sightlines is\nthought to be local to the SMC. There is no significant Galactic foreground\ncomponent. The first three stars lie in the SMC Bar and the line-of-sight for\neach of them passes through regions of recent star formation. The fourth star\nbelongs to the SMC Wing and its line-of-sight passes though a much more\nquiescent region. Thus, the behavior of the dust extinction in the SMC supports\na dependence of dust properties on star formation activity. However, other\nenvironmental factors (such as galactic metallicity) must also be important.\nDust in the 30 Dor region of the LMC, where much more active star formation is\npresent, does not share the extreme extinction properties seen in SMC dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 1998 22:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}
