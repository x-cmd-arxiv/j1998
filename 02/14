At small scales, the cD galaxy in ABCG 85 and the\nbrightest galaxies in the cluster are aligned along this PA. At a larger scale,\nX-ray emission defines a comparable PA south-southeast of ABCG 85 towards ABCG\n87, with a patchy X-ray structure very different from the regular shape of the\noptical galaxy distribution in ABCG 87. The galaxy velocities in the ABCG 87\nregion show the existence of subgroups, which all have an X-ray counterpart,\nand seem to be falling onto ABCG 85 along a filament almost perpendicular to\nthe plane of the sky. To the west of ABCG 85, ABCG 89 appears as a significant\ngalaxy density enhancement, but is barely detected at X-ray wavelengths. The\ngalaxy velocities reveal that in fact this is not a cluster but two groups with\nvery different velocities superimposed along the line of sight. These two\ngroups appear to be located in intersecting sheets on opposite sides of a large\nbubble. These data and their interpretation reinforce the cosmological scenario\nin which matter, including galaxies, groups and gas, falls onto the cluster\nalong a filament.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 1998 16:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

There are 36 single WDs and 5 WDs in binaries known\namong 13 open clusters, and 340 single WDs and 11 WDs in binaries known among\n11 globular clusters. From these data I have calculated WD mass fractions for\nfour open clusters (the Pleiades, NGC 2168, NGC 3532, and the Hyades) and one\nglobular cluster (NGC 6121). I develop a simple model of cluster evolution that\nincorporates stellar evolution but not dynamical evolution to interpret the WD\nmass fractions. I augment the results of my simple model with N-body\nsimulations incorporating stellar evolution (Terlevich 1987; de la Feunte\nMarcos 1996; Vesperini & Heggie 1997). I find that even though these clusters\nundergo moderate to strong kinematical evolution the WD mass fraction is\nrelatively insensitive to kinematical evolution. By comparing the cluster mass\nfunctions to that of the Galactic disk, and incorporating plausibility\narguments for the mass function of the Galactic halo, I estimate the WD mass\nfraction in these two populations. I assume the Galactic disk is ~10 Gyrs old\n(Winget et al. 1987; Liebert, Dahn, & Monet 1988; Oswalt et al. 1996) and that\nthe Galactic halo is ~12 Gyrs old (Reid 1997b; Gratton et al. 1997; Chaboyer et\nal. 1998), although the WD mass fraction is insensitive to age in this range. I\nfind that the Galactic halo should contain 8 to 9% (alpha = -2.35) or perhaps\nas much as 15 to 17% (alpha = -2.0) of its stellar mass in the form of WDs.

As a consequence, if X is\n(I)-free and A is X-simple, then O_X is simple. In the case of Cuntz-Krieger\nalgebras, X-simplicity corresponds to irreducibility of the defining matrix. If\nA is simple and p.i. then O_X is p.i., if A is nonnuclear then O_X is\nnonnuclear. We therefore provide examples of (purely) infinite nonnuclear\nsimple C*-algebras.
