We discuss in detail the\nvarious competing cooling processes for energetic protons, as well as the\ncooling of pions and muons in the hadronic cascade, which impose limits on both\nthe efficiency of neutrino production and the maximum neutrino energy. If the\nproton acceleration process is of the Fermi type, we can derive a model\nindependent upper limit on the neutrino energy from the observed properties of\nany cosmic transient, which depends only on the assumed total energy of the\ntransient. For standard energetic constraints, we can rule out major\ncontributions above 10^19 eV from current models of both blazars and GRBs; and\nin most models much stronger limits apply in order to produce measurable\nneutrino fluxes. For GRBs, we show that the cooling of pions and muons in the\nhadronic cascade imposes the strongest limit on the neutrino energy, leading to\ncutoff energies of the electron and muon neutrino spectrum at the source\ndiffering by about one order of magnitude. We also discuss the relation of\nmaximum cosmic ray energies to maximum neutrino energies and fluxes in GRBs,\nand find that the production of both the highest energy cosmic rays and\nobservable neutrino fluxes at the same site can only be realized under extreme\nconditions; a test implication of this joint scenario would be the existence of\nstrong fluxes of GRB correlated muon neutrinos up to ultra high energies,\n>10^17 eV. Secondary particle cooling also leads to slightly revised estimates\nfor the neutrino fluxes from (non-transient) AGN cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 1998 17:16:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 1998 14:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

We confirm the recent detection of\ncarbon monoxide (CO) in excess of what is predicted by thermochemical\nequilibrium calculations. Carbon is primarily involved in a chemical balance\nbetween methane and CO at the temperatures and pressures present in the outer\nparts of a brown dwarf. At lower temperatures, the balance favors methane,\nwhile in the deeper, hotter regions, the reaction reverses to convert methane\ninto CO. The presence of CO in the observable part of the atmosphere is\ntherefore a sensitive indicator of vertical flows.

However Hawking's discovery of black hole evaporation led to a\nformula for black hole entropy with no subjective element. In this letter, we\nargue from this result, together with the assumption that `black hole\nthermodynamics is just ordinary thermodynamics applied to black holes', that a\nmacrostate for a general (quantum gravitational) closed system is an\nequivalence class of matter-gravity microstates with the same expectation\nvalues for the matter degrees of freedom alone. Not only does this finally\nanswer the question `what is entropy?', but it also predicts the equality of\nthe thermodynamic entropy of a black hole with the matter and the gravity\nentropy-like quantities derived from the Euclidean path integral. Furthermore\nit gives us a clear glimpse of an ultimate synthesis of quantum theory and\ngravity in which we see that (a) gravity acts as a universal environment, thus\npredicting that, if the initial state of the universe is unentangled, its\nentropy must go on increasing forever, (b) the gravitational field has degrees\nof freedom, but no observables, thus enabling gravity to perform the trick of\nproviding an objective continual process of decoherence.
