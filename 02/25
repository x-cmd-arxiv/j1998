The\naccretion of gas by individual stars affects the dynamics of the cluster, and\nthe masses of the stars. Dynamical mass segregation cannot explain the degree\nof mass segregation observed in clusters such as the Trapezium Cluster in\nOrion, implying that the location of the massive stars is an indication of\nwhere they formed. This can, however, be explained by the competitive accretion\nmodel. If most, if not all, stars form in binary systems, then the high\nproportion of pre-main sequence binary systems can evolve in clusters to the\nsmaller proportion of Galactic field stars through binary-binary and\nbinary-single interactions. These models make definite predictions for the\ndistribution of binary properties. The early evolution of a cluster sensitively\ndepends on the primordial binary star proportion. Close encounters between\nstars with circum-stellar discs have drastic effects on the discs and on the\nstellar orbits. The discs are truncated at radii comparable to the encounter\nperi-astron, limiting their lifetimes and affecting their potential for planet\nformation. If the gas represents a significant fraction of the total cluster\nmass, its removal on dynamical time-scales can unbind the cluster allowing the\nstars to escape and populate the field.

It follows that if\nthe two components rotate around the same axis, the counterrotation is\nintrinsic. On the contrary the counterrotation is only apparent if the rotation\naxes are misaligned and the line-of-sight lies in between the two vectors or\ntheir antivectors. In the case of intrinsic counterrotation the two components\ncan be superimposed or radially separated. As far as the two components are\nconcerned, stars are observed to counterrotate with respect to other stars or\ngas. The counterrotation of gas versus gas has been also detected. Up to now,\nthe number of galaxies exhibiting these phenomena are $\\sim60$, the\nmorphological type of which ranges from ellipticals to S0's and to spirals.\n  When a second event occurs in a galaxy, such as the acquisition of material\nfrom outside, it is likely that the resulting angular momentum of the acquired\nmaterial is decoupled from the angular momentum of the preexisting galaxy.\nCounterrotation is therefore a general signature of material acquired from\noutside the main confines of the galaxy. Good examples of such cases are\nellipticals with a dust lane or gaseous disk along the minor axis and polar\nring galaxies, where the angular momenta are perpendicular. It should be noted\nthat recently attempts have been made to explain special cases of stars versus\nstars counterrotation in disk galaxies as due to a self induced phenomenon in\nnon-axisymmetric potentials. We discuss the phenomenon according to the\nmorphological type and to the kind of counterrotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 1998 18:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our approach can be applied to both dielectric and metallic\nsystems of frequency-dependent dielectric function; as well as to objects of\nany size and geometrical properties in principle. We are particularly\ninterested in calculating forces on nanostructures. We find that a body reacts\nto the EM field by minimising its energy, i.e. it is attracted (repelled) by\nregions of lower (higher) EM energy. When travelling waves are involved, forces\ncan be additionally understood in terms of momentum exchange between the body\nand its environment. However when evanescent waves dominate, the forces are\ncomplicated, often become attractive and cannot be explained by means of real\nmomentum being exchanged. We study the EM forces induced by a laser beam on a\ncrysta! l of dielectric GaP spheres. We ob serve effects due to the lattice\nstructure, as well as due to single scattering from each sphere. In the former\ncase the two main features are a maximum momentum exchange when the frequency\nlies within a band gap; and a multitude of force orientations when the Bragg\nconditions for multiple outgoing waves are met. In the latter case the\nradiation couples to the EM eigenmodes of isolated spheres (Mie resonances) and\nvery sharp attractive and repulsive forces occur. Depending on the intensity of\nthe incident radiation these forces can overcome all other interactions present\n(gravitational, thermal and Van der Waals) and may provide the main mechanism\nfor formation of stable structures in colloidal systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 1998 19:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We\ncalculate the scattering amplitude and cross section the practically more\nimportant case that atoms are totally absorbed at the surface of the wire. If\nthe magnetic field is present, there is a dominating Aharonov-Bohm peak in the\nforward direction followed by decreasing oscillations for larger angles.
