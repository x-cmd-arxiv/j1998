However, caustic\ncrossing events are relatively rare, and monitoring them requires intensive\napplication of telescope resources. It is therefore essential that the\nobservational parameters needed to accurately measure the intensity profile are\nquantified. We calculate the expected errors in the recovered radial intensity\nprofile as a function of the unlensed flux, source radius, spatial resolution\nthe recovered intensity profile, and caustic crossing time for the two\nprinciple types of caustics: point-mass and binary lenses. We demonstrate that\nfor both cases there exist simple scaling relations between these parameters\nand the resultant errors. We find that the error as a function of the spatial\nresolution of the recovered profile, parameterized by the number of radial\nbins, increases as $N_R^{3/2}$, considerably faster than the naive $N_R^{1/2}$\nexpectation. Finally, we discuss the relative advantages of binary\ncaustic-crossing events and point-lens events. Binary events are more common,\neasier to plan for, and provide more homogeneous information about the stellar\natmosphere. However, a sub-class of point-mass events with low impact\nparameters can provide dramatically more information provided that they can be\nrecognized in time to initiate observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 1998 18:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
