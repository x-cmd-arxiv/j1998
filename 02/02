By choosing a reference\nSmoluchowski diffusion process, we automatically fix the Feynman-Kac potential\nand the field of local accelerations it induces. We generate the family of\naffiliated diffusions with the same local dynamics, but different inaccessible\nboundaries on finite, semi-infinite and infinite domains. For each diffusion\nprocess a unique Feynman-Kac kernel is obtained by the constrained (Dirichlet\nboundary data) Wiener path integration.As a by-product of the discussion, we\ngive an overview of the problem of inaccessible boundaries for the diffusion\nand bring together (sometimes viewed from unexpected angles) results which are\nlittle known, and dispersed in publications from scarcely communicating areas\nof mathematics and physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 1998 11:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
