The required mass flow rate through shocks in the NLR is thus a few\norders of magnitude higher than the mass accretion rate required to power the\nNLR by the central continuum source. Since gravity appears to dominate the NLR\ncloud dynamics, shocks must lead to an inflow, and the implied high inflow\nrates can be ruled out in most active galaxies. NLR dynamics driven by a\nthermal wind or by some jet configurations may produce the mass flux through\nshocks required for photoionizing shocks to be viable, but the mass flux inward\nfrom the NLR must be kept ~100-1000 times smaller.

The first two effects can be\ndrastic and may completely hamper an X-ray spectral fit with a dusty warm\nabsorber even if a dust-free one was successfully applied to the data. In order\nto demonstrate facets of the dusty warm absorber model and test the recently\nreported important, albeit indirect, evidence for dusty warm material in the\nNarrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 17020+4544 we have analyzed ROSAT PSPC and\nHRI observations of this galaxy.

As a toy model we couple a free scalar boson\nquantum field to an exemplaric heat bath with some given temperature T. It will\nbe shown in detail that the emerging transport equations have to be understood\nas the ensemble average over stochastic equations of Langevin type. This\ncorresponds to the equivalence of the influence functional approach by Feynman\nand Vernon and the CTP technique. The former, however, gives a more intuitive\nphysical picture. In particular the physical role of (quantum) noise and the\nconnection of its correlation kernel to the Kadanoff-Baym equations will be\ndiscussed. The inherent presence of noise and dissipation related by the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem guarantees that the modes or particles become\nthermally populated on average in the long-time limit.

In this context the subtle interplay of P-violation and time\nreversal (T) invariance plays an important role. If the entire field\nconfiguration is chosen to exhibit chirality the energies are in general\nshifted by pseudoscalar contributions which change sign under a planar\nreflection of the field. To calculate the effects we use the standard model of\nelementary particle physics where the P-odd interaction arises through the\nexchange of Z-bosons between the quarks in the nucleus and the atomic\nelectrons. We consider in detail hydrogen-like systems in unstable levels of\nprincipal quantum number n=2. The nominal order of P-violating effects is\n10^-5...10^-9 Hz which is determined by the mixing of the 2S_1/2 and 2P_1/2\nstates. However we point out that it is possible to enhance the P-violating\nenergy shifts dramatically! Instead of energy shifts linear in the P-violation\nparameters we get then shifts proportional to the square root of these\nparameters. Numerically we find such energy shifts to be of order 10^-5...1 Hz.\nApplication of our technique to hydrogen-like atoms with a nucleus of spin\nI=1/2 yields P-violating energy shifts which are very sensitive to the nuclear\nspin dependent P-odd force, which receives a rather large contribution from the\npolarized strange quark density in polarized nuclei.
