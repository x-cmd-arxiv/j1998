The model includes a complete IRAS 25\\micron\nselected sample of 1406 local galaxies ($z \\leq 0.1$; Shupe et al. 1998a).\nResults based on these 1406 spectra show that the MIR emission features cause\nsignificant effects on the redshift dependence of the K-corrections for fluxes\nin the WIRE 25\\micron band and ISOCAM 15\\micron band. This in turn will affect\ndeep counts and redshift distributions in these two bands, as shown by the\npredictions of two evolution models (a luminosity evolution model with\n$L\\propto (1+z)^3$ and a density evolution model with $\\rho\\propto (1+z)^4$).\nThe dips-and-bumps on curves of MIR number counts, caused by the emission\nfeatures, should be useful indicators of evolution mode.
