The first involves a decomposition of the polytope\ninto simplices. The second involves the enumeration of ``magic squares'', i.e.,\nn by n non-negative integer matrices whose rows and columns all sum to the same\ninteger.\n  We have used the first method to confirm the previously known values through\nn=7. This method can also be used to compute the volumes of faces of B_n. For\nexample, we have observed that the volume of a particular face of B_n appears\nto be a product of Catalan numbers.\n  We have used the second method to find the volume for n=8, which we believe\nwas not previously known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 1998 02:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For a sufficiently large voltage, such a film is unstable to\nradially-driven electroconvection due to charges which develop on its free\nsurfaces. The film can also be subjected to a Couette shear by rotating its\ninner edge. This combination is experimentally realized using films of smectic\nA liquid crystals. In the absence of shear, the convective flow consists of a\nstationary, azimuthally one-dimensional pattern of symmetric, counter-rotating\nvortex pairs. When Couette flow is applied, an azimuthally traveling pattern\nresults. When viewed in a co-rotating frame, the traveling pattern consists of\npairs of asymmetric vortices. We calculate the neutral stability boundary for\narbitrary radius ratio $\\alpha$ and Reynolds number ${{\\cal R} e}$ of the shear\nflow, and obtain the critical control parameter ${\\cal R}_c (\\alpha, {{\\cal R}\ne})$ and the critical azimuthal mode number ${m_c (\\alpha, {{\\cal R} e})}$.

The dispersion relations obtained are equivalent to the standard\nclassical Sellmeir equations obtained from the Drude-Lorentz model. In the\nhomogeneous (plane-wave) case, we obtain the detailed quantum mode structure of\nthe coupled polariton fields, and show that the mode expansion in all branches\nof the dispersion relation is completely defined by the refractive index and\nthe group-velocity for the polaritons. We demonstrate a straightforward\nprocedure for exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in one, two or\nthree-dimensional environments, even in the presence of longitudinal\nphonon-exciton dispersion, and an arbitrary number of resonant transitions with\ndifferent frequencies. This is essential, since it is necessary to include at\nleast one phonon (I.R.) and one exciton (U.V.) mode, in order to accurately\nrepresent dispersion in transparent solid media. Our method of diagonalization\ndoes not require an explicit solution of the dispersion relation, but relies\ninstead on the analytic properties of Cauchy contour integrals over all\npossible mode frequencies. When there is longitudinal phonon dispersion, the\nrelevant group-velocity term is modified so that it only includes the purely\nelectromagnetic part of the group velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 1998 23:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
