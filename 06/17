By targeting redshifts which bring\nthe lines of interest into gaps between the strong OH sky emission, we have\nbeen successful in detecting Balmer and [O III] emission lines in all five\ngalaxies observed so far with CGS4 on UKIRT. For a Salpeter IMF and a H_0 = 70\nkm/s/Mpc, q_0 = 0.1 cosmology, the Hbeta luminosities uncorrected for dust\nextinction imply star formation rates of 20 - 270 solar masses per year. On the\nbasis of the present limited sample it appears that an extinction of 1 - 2\nmagnitudes at 1500 A may be typical of Lyman break galaxies. This value is\nconsistent with recent estimates of dust obscuration in star forming galaxies\nat z < 1, and does not require a substantial revision of the broad picture of\nstar formation over the Hubble time proposed by Madau et al. (1996). In four\nout of five cases the velocity dispersion of the emission line gas is sigma =\n70 km/s, while in the fifth the line widths are nearly three times larger.\nVirial masses in the range from 1 x 10^{10} to 5 x 10^{10} solar masses are\nsuggested, but both velocities and masses could be higher because our\nobservations are only sensitive to the brightest cores of these systems where\nthe line widths may not sample the full gravitational potential. The relative\nredshifts of interstellar absorption, nebular emission, and Lyman alpha\nemission lines differ by several hundred km/s and suggest that large-scale\noutflows may be a common characteristic of Lyman break galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 1998 16:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The high\nresolution echelle spectroscopic observations taken in 12-21th January 1998\nexhibit a dramatic increase in the chromospheric emissions (H_alpha and CaII\nIRT lines) that we interpret as a flare based on: the temporal evolution of the\nevent, the broad component observed in the H_alpha line profile, the detection\nof the HeI D_3 in emission and a filled-in HeI 6678 A. During these obsevations\nwe detect a LiI 6708 A line enhancement which is clearly related with the\ntemporal evolution of the flare. The maximum LiI enhancement occurs just after\nthe maximum chromospheric emission observed in the flare. A significant\nincrease of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is also detected. From all this we\nsuggest that this LiI enhancement is produced by spallation reactions during\nthe flare. This is the first time that such LiI enhancement associate with a\nstellar flare is reported, and probably the long-duration of this flare is a\nkey factor for this detection. A large fraction of the stellar surface seems to\nbe covered by starspots during the event, as we deduce for the analysis of the\nTiO 7055 A band. Thus taking into account that LiI line is very temperature\nsensitive, we can not discard that the LiI variations are related the presence\nof starspots. However, the correlation with the temporal evolution of the\nflare, lack of detection of changes in the other photospheric absorption lines,\nand the large changes observed in the core of the LiI, as predict the models,\nargue in favour of the hypothesis that the LiI is produced during the flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 1998 22:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It provides a set of spectroscopic standards\ncovering the full range of gravities and metallicities in the effective\ntemperature interval [4000 K, 6300 K]. The spectra are straightened, wavelength\ncalibrated, cleaned of cosmic ray hits, bad pixels and telluric lines. They\ncover the spectral range [440 nm, 680 nm] with an instrumental resolution of\n42000. For each star, basic data were compiled from the Hipparcos catalogue and\nthe Hipparcos Input Catalogue. Radial velocities with a precision better than\n100 m/s are given. Atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) from the\nliterature are discussed. Because of scattered determinations in the\nbibliography, even for the most well-known stars, these parameters were\nadjusted by an iterative process which takes account of common or different\nspectral features between the standards, using our homogeneous set of spectra.\nRevised values of (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) are proposed. They are still consistent\nwith the literature, and also lead to the self-consistency of the library, in\nthe sense that similar spectra have similar atmospheric parameters. This\nadjustment was performed by using step by step a method based on the least\nsquare comparison of carefully prepared spectra, which was originally developed\nfor the on-line estimation of the atmospheric parameters of faint field stars\n(companion paper in the main journal). The spectra and corresponding data will\nonly be available in electronic form at the CDS (ftp cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr or\nhttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Abstract.html).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 1998 14:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

These three types of\nhypersurfaces are considered in parallel. Spacelike hypersurfaces are endowed\nwith a proper conformal structure, and timelike hypersurfaces are endowed with\na conformal structure of Lorentzian type. Geometry of these two types of\nhypersurfaces can be studied in a manner that is similar to that for\nhypersurfaces of a proper conformal space. Lightlike hypersurfaces are endowed\nwith a degenerate conformal structure. This is the reason that their\ninvestigation has special features. It is proved that under the Darboux mapping\nsuch hypersurfaces are transferred into tangentially degenerate\n(n-1)-dimensional submanifolds of rank n-2 located on the Darboux hyperquadric.\nThe isotropic congruences of the space C^n_1 that are closely connected with\nlightlike hypersurfaces and their Darboux mapping are also considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 1998 21:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The Ewald treatment\npermits a conclusive extrapolation to infinite system size. The picture that\nemerges from testing of simple models is that the most prominent failings of\nthe simplest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that\nlead to non-gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials. Thus, the most\nfavorable cases for the second-order perturbation theories are monoatomic\npositive ions. For polar and anionic solutes, continuum or gaussian theories\nare less accurate. The appreciation of the specific deficiencies of those\nsimple models have led to new concepts, multistate gaussian and quasi-chemical\ntheories, that address the cases for which the simpler theories fail.
