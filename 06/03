The 300 Hz and 0.1 Hz QPOs appear only at the\nhighest observed luminosities (Lx > 0.15 Ledd), where the power-law component\ndominates the X-ray spectrum. At lower luminosity, the disk flux exceeds the\npower-law flux and only two of the QPOs are observed: the spectrally \"soft\" 9\nHz QPO, and the narrow, \"hard\" QPO that varies from 14-28 Hz as the hard flux\ndecreases. The 300 Hz QPO is likely to be analogous to the stationary QPO at 67\nHz seen in the microquasar GRS1915+105. We discuss models of these\nhigh-frequency QPOs which depend on effects due to general relativity. The 9 Hz\nQPO displays a spectrum consistent with a thermal origin, but this frequency\ndoes not appear to be consistent with any of the natural time scales associated\nwith the disk, or with the inferred values of the mass and rapid spin of the\nblack hole. The mechanism for the 14-28 Hz QPOs appears to be linked to the\npower-law component, as do the 1-10 Hz QPOs in GRS1915+105. Finally, we show\ndata for GRO J1655-40 and GRS1915+105 as each source teeters between relative\nstability and a state of intense oscillations at 0.1 Hz. A comparison of the\nsources' spectral parameters allows us to speculate that the black hole mass in\nGRS1915+105 is very large, possibly in the range 39-70 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 1998 13:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

The\nfocus is to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with\ndifferent approximations to the relaxational dynamics: Boltzmann, non-Markovian\nand Markovian quantum kinetics. The time evolution of the distribution function\nis evaluated exactly using two methods: time evolution of an initially prepared\ndensity matrix and by solving the Heisenberg equations of motion. There are two\ndifferent cases that are studied in detail: i) no stable particle states below\nthreshold of the bath and a quasiparticle resonance above it and ii) a stable\ndiscrete exact `particle' state below threshold. For the case of quasiparticles\nin the continuum (resonances) the exact quasiparticle distribution\nasymptotically tends to a statistical equilibrium distribution that differs\nfrom a simple Bose-Einstein form as a result of off-shell processes. In the\ncase ii), the distribution of particles does not thermalize with the bath. We\nstudy the kinetics of thermalization and relaxation by deriving a non-Markovian\nquantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes\noff-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell\ncontributions and the usual Boltzmann equation are obtained from the quantum\nkinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different\ncoarse-graining assumptions. The relaxational dynamics predicted by the\nnon-Markovian, Markovian and Boltzmann approximations are compared to the exact\nresult of the model.

We\ndetermine the ground state mass in the vector channel from the Euclidean time\nFourier transform of the correlator, which has an exponential falloff at large\ntimes. The ground state mass lies around 590 MeV and is almost independent of\nthe model form for the gluon propagator. This method allows us to stay in\nEuclidean space and to avoid analytic continuation of the quark or gluon\npropagators into the timelike region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 1998 15:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
