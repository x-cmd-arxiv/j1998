This, as well as being interesting in its own right, provides\ninsight into the dynamical and statistical mechanical properties of\ngravitational systems: the possibility of the existence of stable equilibrium\nstates and the associated relaxation time would provide an ideal situation\nwhere relaxation theory can be tested. Indeed, these states are found to exist\nfor single mass $N$-body systems, and the condition condition for this is\nsimply that obtained from elementary thermodynamical considerations applied to\nself-gravitating ideal gas spheres. However, even when this condition is\nsatisfied, some initial states may not end as isothermal spheres. It is\ntherefore only a necessary condition. Simple considerations also predict that,\nfor fixed total mass, energy and radius, stable isothermal spheres are unique.\nTherefore, statistically irreversible perturbations to the density profile\ncaused by the accumulation of massive particles near the centre of multimass\nsystems, destroy these equilibria if the aforementioned quantities are kept\nfixed. The time-scale for this to happen was found to be remarkably short (a\nfew dynamical times when $N= 2500$) in systems undergoing violent relaxation.\nThe time taken to achieve thermal equilibrium depended on the initial\nconditions and could be comparable to a dynamical time (even when the\nconditions for violent relaxation were not satisfied) or the two body\nrelaxation time. The relaxation time for velocity anisotropies was intermediate\nbetween these two time-scales, being long compared to the dynamical time but\nmuch (about four times) shorter than the time-scale of energy relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 1998 14:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
