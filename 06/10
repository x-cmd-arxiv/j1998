The main goal of this\nproject is to determine the ionization equilibrium and abundances (IEA) in BAL\noutflows. Previous studies of IEA in BALQSOs were based on the assumption that\nthe BALs are not saturated so that the column densities inferred from the\napparent optical depths are realistic. This critical assumption is at odds with\nseveral recent observations and with analysis of existing data which indicate\nthat the absorption troughs are heavily saturated even when they are not black.\nIn addition, X-ray observations, which are important for constraining the\nionizing continuum, were not available for those objects that had UV spectral\ndata. Quantifying the level of saturation in the BALs necessitates UV\nspectroscopy with much higher S/N and broader spectral coverage than currently\nexist. After taking into account the capabilities of available observatories,\nour best hope for a substantial improvement in understanding the IEA in BALQSOs\nis to concentrate considerable observational resources on the most promising\nobject. Our studies of available HST and ground-based spectra show that\nPG~0946+301 is by far the best candidate for such a program. This BALQSO is at\nleast five times brighter, shortward of 1000 A rest frame, than any other\nobject, and due to its low redshift it has an especially sparse Lya forest. At\nthe same time PG~0946+301 is a typical BALQSO and therefore its IEA should be\nrepresentative. To this effect we are developing a multiwavelength\nspectroscopic campaign (UV, FUV, X-ray and optical) on BALQSO PG 0946+301.

The diverging morphological evolution of both models is\nexplained in terms of gas radial inflow, the resulting change in the\ngravitational potential at smaller radii, and the subsequent modification of\nthe main families of orbits, both in and out of the disk plane.\n  We find that dynamical instabilities become milder in the presence of the gas\ncomponent, and that the stability of planar and 3D stellar orbits is strongly\naffected by the related changes in the potential -- both are destabilized with\nthe gas accumulation at the center. This is reflected in the overall lower\namplitude of the bar mode and in the substantial weakening of the bar, which\nappears to be a gradual process.

In\nthe limit for N -> oo, p_N tends to a Gaussian. However, the form of the\nsingle-vortex velocity causes very slow convergence with N; for N ~ 10^6 the\nnon-Gaussian high-velocity tails still play a significant role. At finite N,\nthe Gaussian component is well modeled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) stochastic\nprocess with variance sigma_N = sqrt{N ln N /2 pi}.

In the morpheme-to-phoneme conversion module,\neach morpheme in the phrase is converted into phonetic patterns by looking up\nthe morpheme phonetic pattern dictionary which contains candidate phonological\nchanges in boundaries of the morphemes. Graphemes within a morpheme are grouped\ninto CCV patterns and converted into phonemes by the CCV conversion rules. The\nphoneme connectivity table supports grammaticality checking of the adjacent two\nphonetic morphemes.\n  In the experiments with a corpus of 4,973 sentences, we achieved 99.9% of the\ngrapheme-to-phoneme conversion performance and 97.5% of the sentence conversion\nperformance. The full Korean TTS system is now being implemented using this\nconversion method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 1998 13:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the case of kinesin, protein heads bind\nprimarily on the alpha tubulin site of asymmetric alpha-beta 8nm-long tubulin\ndimers that constitute the microtubular protofilaments. Kinesin dimers overcome\nlocal binding forces up to 5pN and are known to move on protofilaments with ATP\nconcentration-dependent speeds while hydrolizing on average one ATP molecule\nper 8nm step. The salient features of protein trajectories are the distinct\nabrupt usually 8nm-long steps from one tubulin dimer to the next interlaced\nwith long quiescent binding periods at a tubulin site. Discrete walks of this\ntype are characterized by substantially reduced variances compared to pure\nbiased random walks, and as a result rule out flashing-type ratchet models as\npossible mechanisms for motor movement. On the other hand, simple additive\ncorrelated brownian ratchets that present exactly these discrete trajectory\npatterns with reduced variances are compatible with the general features of\nprotein motion. In the simplest such model the protein is simplified to a\nsingle particle moving in a periodic non-symmetric tubulin-derived potential\nand the environmental and ATP interaction is included in a correlated additive\nnoise term. For this model we show that the resulting protein walk has features\nresembling experimental data.
