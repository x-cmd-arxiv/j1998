In this\npaper, we show that the unification scale can be significantly lowered (perhaps\neven to the TeV scale) through the appearance of extra spacetime dimensions.\nSuch extra dimensions are a natural consequence of string theories with\nlarge-radius compactifications. We show that extra spacetime dimensions\nnaturally lead to gauge coupling unification at intermediate mass scales, and\nmoreover may provide a natural mechanism for explaining the fermion mass\nhierarchy by permitting the fermion masses to evolve with a power-law\ndependence on the mass scale. We also show that proton-decay constraints may be\nsatisfied in our scenario due to the higher-dimensional cancellation of\nproton-decay amplitudes to all orders in perturbation theory. Finally, we\nextend these results by considering theories without supersymmetry;\nexperimental collider signatures; and embeddings into string theory. The latter\nalso enables us to develop several novel methods of explaining the fermion mass\nhierarchy via $D$-branes. Our results therefore suggest a new approach towards\nunderstanding the physics of grand unification as well as the phenomenology of\nlarge-radius string compactifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 1998 23:55:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 1998 03:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
