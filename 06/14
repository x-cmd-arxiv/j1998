The common linear and deterministic relation g=b*d between the\ndensity fluctuation fields of galaxies g and mass d is replaced by the\nconditional distribution P(g|d) of these random fields, smoothed at a given\nscale at a given time. The nonlinearity is characterized by the conditional\nmean <g|d>=b(d)*d, while the local scatter is represented by the conditional\nvariance s_b^2(d) and higher moments. The scatter arises from hidden factors\naffecting galaxy formation and from shot noise unless it has been properly\nremoved. For applications involving second-order local moments, the biasing is\ndefined by three natural parameters: the slope b_h of the regression of g on d,\na nonlinearity b_t, and a scatter s_b. The ratio of variances b_v^2 and the\ncorrelation coefficient r mix these parameters. The nonlinearity and the\nscatter lead to underestimates of order b_t^2/b_h^2 and s_b^2/b_h^2 in the\ndifferent estimators of beta (=Omega^0.6/b_h). The nonlinear effects are\ntypically smaller. Local stochasticity affects the redshift-distortion analysis\nonly by limiting the useful range of scales, especially for power spectra. In\nthis range, for linear stochastic biasing, the analysis reduces to Kaiser's\nformula for b_h (not b_v), independent of the scatter. The distortion analysis\nis affected by nonlinear properties of biasing but in a weak way. Estimates of\nthe nontrivial features of the biasing scheme are made based on simulations and\ntoy models, and strategies for measuring them are discussed.
