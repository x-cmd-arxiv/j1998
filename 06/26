I\nmodeled the evolution of the energy spectrum during intensity dips with a\nvariably absorbed bright component plus a fainter unabsorbed component. I show\nthat variability not attributable to absorption dips is related to the\nspectral/intensity states of the ``Z source'' class of low-mass X-ray binaries\n(LMXBs), namely motion along (or shifts of) the horizontal, normal, and flaring\nbranches of the ``Z'' track in color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams. I\nfound rapid X-ray variability properties associated with each\nspectral/intensity state: On the horizontal branch, quasi-periodic oscillations\n(QPOs) in the X-ray intensity shift in frequency from 1.3 to 35 Hz. On the\nnormal branch, a different QPO occurs at about 4 Hz. On the flaring branch only\nstrong aperiodic variability occurs. I also modeled the evolution of the energy\nspectra associated with each of these branches. To study mass transfer in an\neccentric binary, I developed computer codes for transfer via Roche-lobe\noverflow and from a stellar wind. I derive theoretical mass accretion profiles\nand compare them to the observed profile of the X-ray intensity. In order to\nexplore the possible evolutionary history of Circinus X-1, I developed a\nbinary-evolution computer code for a neutron-star and low-mass companion in an\neccentric orbit. I use this code in a population-synthesis study to show that\nthe number of systems in the Galaxy expected to resemble Cir X-1 is of order\nunity, consistent with its unique status as an LMXB with high eccentricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 1998 20:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Numerical\nsimulations for the protogalactic collapse suggest strongly that galactic\nbulges have been assembled from massive clumps formed in the galactic disks in\ntheir early evolutionary phase. These clumps result from the gravitational\ninstability of the gas-rich disks of young galaxies. Those massive clumps,\nindividual masses of which can be as large as one billion solar masses, are\nable to spiral toward the galactic center owing to dynamical frictions within a\nfew Gyr. Inward transport of disk matter by this process leads to the formation\nof a galactic bulge. A simple analytical model has been constructed, in which\nthe clumpy evolution of a disk galaxy is controlled by two parameters; the\ntimescale with which the primordial gas in the halo accretes onto the disk\nplane (i.e., collapse timescale) and the mass fraction of the primordial gas\nrelative to the galaxy total mass. Under plausible assumptions for the\nvariation of these parameters among spiral galaxies, the clumpy evolution model\ncan explain the observed trend that the bulge-to-disk ratio increases as the\ntotal mass or the internal density of the galaxy increases. This success\nsuggests that the clumpy evolution of the galactic disk constitutes an\nimportant ingredient of the disk galaxy evolution. Star formation in primeval\ndisk galaxies takes place mostly in the clumps. Resulting knotty appearance of\nthese systems may explain the peculiar morphology observed in a number of\nhigh-redshift galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 1998 09:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

A value of the strong coupling constant of alpha_s(M_Z^2)=\n0.118+- 0.002 (stat.)^(+0.007)_(-0.008) (syst.)^(+0.007)_(-0.006) (theory) is\nextracted. The systematic error includes uncertainties in the calorimeter\nenergy calibration, in the description of the data by current Monte Carlo\nmodels, and in the knowledge of the parton densities. The theoretical error is\ndominated by the renormalization scale ambiguity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 1998 19:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The produced\nfermions may be leptons, down-quarks or up-quarks, and the center of mass\nenergies may range from the Z-boson pole up to $ 1000$ GeV. Off the Z-boson\npole, the flavor changing rates are controlled by tree level amplitudes and the\nCP asymmetries by interference terms between tree and loop level amplitudes. At\nthe Z-boson pole, both observables involve loop amplitudes. The lepton number\nviolating interactions, associated with the coupling constants, $\\l_{ijk},\n\\l'_{ijk}$, are only taken into account. The consideration of loop amplitudes\nis restricted to the photon and Z-boson vertex corrections. We briefly review\nflavor violation physics at colliders.

However this nucleus provides two unpaired neutrons and a low threshold\nfor solar neutrino absorption, resulting in an unusually large cross section.\nThe 18O nuclei, together with 17O and deuterium, will produce in excess of 460\nscattered electrons per year with energies above the initial SuperKamiokande\nthreshold of 6.5 MeV, or about 6.7% of the total solar neutrino signal, for an\nelectron neutrino flux scaled to the current SuperKamiokande counting rate. We\nexplore whether this might complicate efforts to extract the neutrino spectrum\nfrom elastic scattering events and whether there might be any prospect of\ncombining 18O and elastic scattering events to separate charged and neutral\ncurrent interactions. Under current operating conditions the answers are no, as\nthe Fermi, Gamow Teller, and forbidden contributions to the 18O cross section\nconspire to produce a nearly isotropic cross section. Thus most of the events\nare indistinguishable from background. This result is relevant to\nSuperKamiokande detection of solar antineutrinos, which arise in certain\noscillation scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 1998 04:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

With no specification of the final state, the method\nis restricted to inclusive reactions. The time--dependent mean field method, as\ndeveloped by Kerman, Levit and Negele as well as by Reinhardt, calculates the\ndensity for specific transitions and thus applies to exclusive reactions. It\nuses the Hubbard--Stratonovich transformation to express the full\ntime--development operator with two--body interactions as functional integral\nover one--body densities. In stationary phase approximation and with Slater\ndeterminants as initial and final states, it defines non--Hermitian,\ntime--dependent mean field equations to be solved self--consistently as\nboundary value problem in time. The time--independent mean field method of\nGiraud and Nagarajan is based on a Schwinger--type variational principle for\nthe resolvent. It leads to a set of inhomogeneous, non--Hermitian equations of\nHartree--Fock type to be solved for given total energy. All information about\ninitial and final channels is contained in the inhomogeneities, hence the\nmethod is designed for exclusive reactions.

Its formulation based\non introducing an inertial reference system by rigid linking of clocks to a\nfree entity to define proper time is self-contradictory since the operation of\nrigid linking involves interaction which is excluded by definition for a free\nentity. The way to overcome this inconsistency is proposed by postulating that\neach free entity (object, particle) has to be ideal clocks by itself, providing\nideal internal time standards defined by the only intrinsic feature of a free\nentity, namely its proper mass which means that de Broglie's periodic\nphenomenon has to be considered as a fundamental principle needed to built the\nspecial relativity, along with the principle of indistinguishability allowing\nto define the particle's proper mass with ideal accuracy. Further, the internal\ndistance standard is provided by passing to Compton wavelength and the velocity\nstandard is introduced by means of Hubble's law. It is proposed to interpret\nthe wave function as an internal system of reference undergoing distortion when\nexternal interaction is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 1998 15:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
