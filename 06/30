We also analyze archival ROSAT PSPC\nobservations. We find that the X-ray emission is dominated by the quasar. The\nflux varied by a factor of about two between the ROSAT HRI and ASCA\nobservations, which were about one year apart. The X-ray spectrum of the quasar\nis fit by a single power-law, except at low energies where there is a soft\nexcess. Although the shape of the soft excess is not strongly constrained, it\ncan be fit by a blackbody with a temperature of about 30 eV. There was evidence\nfor extended X-ray emission, which contributed about 25% of the total flux.\nHowever, this emission does not appear to be normal X-ray emission from\nintracluster gas or a central cooling flow. The extended X-ray emission appears\nto be quite soft; if its spectrum is modeled as thermal emission, the\ntemperature is ~0.2 keV, rather than the 5-10 keV expected for ICM emission.\nThe radial surface distribution of the emission was not fit by either the beta\nmodel which usually describes ICM emission, or by a cooling flow model. The\nASCA and ROSAT spectra showed no convincing evidence for a thermal component\nwith a cluster-like temperature, either in the overall spectral shape or in\nemission lines. In addition, the ROSAT PSPC image showed that the extended\nX-ray emission was highly elongated to the NNW and SSE, in the same direction\nas the extended radio emission from the quasar. We suggest that the extended\nemission is inverse Compton emission from the extended radio lobes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 1998 16:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Thus, large mass\nratio of dark matter (DM) to baryonic matter (i.e., large $M_{\\rm vir}/L$) is\nrealized in a low-mass ($M_{\\rm vir}<10^8M_\\odot$) dSph through the gas\ndepletion, whereas $M_{\\rm vir}/L$ becomes lower in high-mass ($M_{\\rm\nvir}>10^8M_\\odot$) dSphs.
