To examine this possibility, we investigate\nthe stellar contents and star formation history, and model the evolution of the\nshell. H-R diagrams constructed from UBV photometry and spectral\nclassifications indicate highly coeval star formation, with the entire massive\nstar population having an age of ~< 2-3 Myr. However, LH 54 is constrained to\nan age of ~3 Myr by the presence of a WR star, and the IMF for LH 51 suggests a\nlower-mass limit implying an age of 1-2 Myr. There is no evidence of an earlier\nstellar population to create the superbubble, but the modeled shell kinematics\nare consistent with an origin due to the strongest stellar winds of LH 54. It\nmight therefore be possible that LH 54 created the superbubble, which in turn\nmay have triggered the creation of LH 51. Within the errors, the spatial\ndistribution of stellar masses and IMF appear uniform within the associations.\n  We reinvestigate the estimates for stellar wind power L_w(t), during the\nH-burning phase, and note that revised mass-loss rates yield a significantly\ndifferent form for L_w(t), and may affect stellar evolution timescales. We also\nmodel superbubble expansion into an ambient medium with a sudden, discontinuous\ndrop in density, and find that this can easily reproduce the anomalously high\nshell expansion velocities seen in many superbubbles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 1998 19:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence\nknown as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard\nvariations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in\nNNF given a structured system description.

For SPS energy and pT<2 GeV, overall good agreement of the pT\ndistributions with data is found when freeze-out occurs along the T=130 MeV\nisotherm. Even high-pT neutral pion data can be described for a particular\nchoice of the initial transverse density profile. It is shown that the average\ntransverse velocity <vT> of heavy hadrons and hadronic clusters is a good\nmeasure for the collective flow velocity. The latter is found to be rather\nsimilar for SPS and RHIC energies, due to the ``stall'' of the flow within the\nlong-lived mixed phase at RHIC. In case of thermalization and hydrodynamical\nexpansion, the mean transverse momentum <pT> increases linearly with the hadron\nmass. In contrast, the string model FRITIOF7.02, which does not account for\nrescattering of secondary hadrons, predicts a strong dependence of <pT> on the\nquark composition of the hadron. Due to the different sensitivity to hard\nprocesses, hadrons with charm (anti-)quarks acquire significantly more\ntransverse momentum than hadrons without c (or even without s) quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 1998 15:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 1998 14:16:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 1998 14:46:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 1998 16:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A systematic phenomenological model of the\nEFISH phenomenon, including a detailed description of the space charge region\n(SCR) at the semiconductor-dielectric interface in accumulation, depletion, and\ninversion regimes, has been developed. The influence of surface quantization\neffects, interface states, charge traps in the oxide layer, doping\nconcentration and oxide thickness on nonlocal screening of the DC-electric\nfield and on breaking of inversion symmetry in the SCR is considered. The model\ndescribes EFISH generation in the SCR using a Green function formalism which\ntakes into account all retardation and absorption effects of the fundamental\nand second harmonic (SH) waves, optical interference between field-dependent\nand field-independent contributions to the SH field and multiple reflection\ninterference in the SiO$_2$ layer.
