This incorporates assumptions about the cosmological parameters,\nthe properties of primordial fluctuations, and the biasing relation between\ngalaxies and mass. These can be tested by comparing the reconstruction to the\nobserved galaxy distribution, and to peculiar velocity data. This paper\npresents a hybrid reconstruction method that combines the `Gaussianization''\ntechnique of Weinberg(1992) with the dynamical schemes of Nusser & Dekel(1992)\nand Gramann(1993). We test the method on N-body simulations and on N-body mock\ncatalogs that mimic the depth and geometry of the Point Source Catalog Redshift\nSurvey and the Optical Redshift Survey. This method is more accurate than\nGaussianization or dynamical reconstruction alone. Matching the observed\nmorphology of clustering can limit the bias factor b, independent of Omega.\nMatching the cluster velocity dispersions and z-space distortions of the\ncorrelation function xi(s,mu) constrains the parameter beta=Omega^{0.6}/b.\nRelative to linear or quasi-linear approximations, a fully non-linear\nreconstruction makes more accurate predictions of xi(s,mu) for a given beta,\nthus reducing the systematic biases of beta measurements and offering further\nscope for breaking the degeneracy between Omega and b. It also circumvents the\ncosmic variance noise that limits conventional analyses of xi(s,mu). It can\nalso improve the determination of Omega and b from joint analyses of redshift\n  & peculiar velocity surveys as it predicts the fully non-linear peculiar\nvelocity distribution at each point in z-space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 1998 19:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

As an example, we investigate the\nevolution of models for the globular cluster NGC 6254. Using the Hipparcos\nproper motions, we are now able to construct orbits of this cluster in the\nGalaxy.

The idea is that the GUT scale is fixed by the vacuum expectation\nvalue of a \"GUT modulus\" field whose potential is exactly flat in the\nsupersymmetric limit. If supersymmetry is broken by gauge mediation, a\npotential for the GUT modulus is generated at 2 loops, and slopes away from the\norigin for a wide range of parameters. This potential is stabilized by\nPlanck-suppressed operators in the Kahler potential, and the GUT scale is fixed\nto be of order M_* / (4\\pi^2) (where M_* ~ 10^{18} GeV is the reduced Planck\nscale) independently of the supersymmetry breaking scale. The cosmology of this\nscenario is acceptable if there is an epoch of inflation with reheat\ntemperature small compared to the supersymmetry-breaking scale. We construct a\nrealistic GUT that realizes these ideas. The model is based on the gauge group\nSU(6), and solves the doublet-triplet splitting problem by a sliding singlet\nmechanism. The GUT sector contains no dimensionful couplings or tuned\nparameters, and all mass scales other than the Planck scale are generated\ndynamically.

This result can\nbe interpreted as a strengthening of Bell's no-hidden-variables theorem, and\nrelies on causality and quantum entanglement in a manner similar to Bell's\noriginal argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 1998 00:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2000 21:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
