Roughly speaking, their idea was that a definite\ntemperature can be attributed to a system only if it is submerged in a heat\nbath, in which case energy fluctuations are unavoidable. On the other hand, a\ndefinite energy can only be assigned to systems in thermal isolation, thus\nexcluding the simultaneous determination of its temperature.\n  Rosenfeld extended this analogy with quantum mechanics and obtained a\nquantitative uncertainty relation in the form (Delta U) (Delta (1/T)) >= k\nwhere k is Boltzmann's constant. The two `extreme' cases of this relation would\nthen characterize this complementarity between isolation (U definite) and\ncontact with a heat bath (T definite). Other formulations of the\nthermodynamical uncertainty relations were proposed by Mandelbrot (1956, 1989),\nLindhard (1986) and Lavenda (1987, 1991). This work, however, has not led to a\nconsensus in the literature.\n  It is shown here that the uncertainty relation for temperature and energy in\nthe version of Mandelbrot is indeed exactly analogous to modern formulations of\nthe quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. However, his relation holds only\nfor the canonical distribution, describing a system in contact with a heat\nbath. There is, therefore, no complementarity between this situation and a\nthermally isolated system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 1998 15:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

First, we investigate\nthe topological conditions on spacetime under which the action for a non-chiral\n$p$-form can be split as the sum of the actions for two chiral $p$-forms, one\nof each chirality. When these conditions are not met, we exhibit explicitly the\nextra topological degrees of freedom and their couplings to the chiral modes.\nSecond, we study the problem of constructing Lorentz-invariant self-couplings\nof a chiral $p$-form in the light of the Dirac-Schwinger condition on the\nenergy-momentum tensor commutation relations. We show how the Perry-Schwarz\ncondition follows from the Dirac-Schwinger criterion and point out that\nconsistency of the gravitational coupling is automatic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 1998 11:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 1998 11:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Sep 1999 12:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}
