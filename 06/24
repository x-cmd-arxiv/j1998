The\nresidual fraction of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star\nforming molecular clouds and the cirrus. The relative amount is a model\nparameter. The molecular gas is sub--divided into clouds of given mass and\nradius: it is supposed that each SSP is born within the cloud and progressively\nescapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star forming molecular clouds is\ncomputed with a radiative transfer code. The cirrus emission is derived by\ndescribing the galaxy as an axially symmetric system, in which the local dust\nemissivity is consistently calculated as a function of the local field\nintensity due to the stellar component.

We show that under\nquantum Zeno dynamics not only the transition probability (leading to quantum\nZeno effect) but also phases are affected. We call this new effect as quantum\nZeno phase effect (QZPE) which says that under repeated measurements the\ngeometric phase of a quantum system can be inhibited. Since geometric phase\nattributes a memory to a quatum system this result also proves that under\nquantum Zeno dynamics the memory of a system can be erased. We have proposed a\nneutron interference experiment where this prediction can be tested. We also\nbeleive that with Itano's kind of set up for two-level systems this prediction\ncan be tested. This will provide a new way of controlling phase shift in\ninterference experiment by doing repeated measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 1998 07:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
