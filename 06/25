It is then suggested that\nquantum statistical regularities also could derive from this measure. An\nexplicit definition of such a measure is proposed, using both a simplified\nmodel of the universe based on classical mechanics and the non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics formalism. The peculiarity of such a measure is that it does\nnot apply to the initial conditions of the universe, i.e. to the initial\npositions and momenta of particles, but to their initial and final positions,\nfrom which the path is derived by means of the least action principle. This\nformulation of the problem is crucial and it is supported by the observation\nthat it is incorrect to liken the determination of the boundary conditions of\nthe universe to the preparation of a laboratory system, in which the initial\nconditions of the system are obviously determined. Some possible objections to\nthis theory are then discussed. Specifically, the EPR paradox is discussed, and\nit is explained by showing that, in general, a measure on the boundary\nconditions of the universe generates preinteractive correlations, and that in\nthe presence of such correlations Bell's inequality can no longer be proven\ntrue. Finally, it is shown that if one broadens the dynamical scheme of the\ntheory to encompass phenomena such as particle decay and annihilation, the\nleast action principle allows for an indeterministic evolution of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 1998 19:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
