An unusual feature of our reduction procedure is\nthe creation of images with constant RMS noise from such mosaics. We adopted\nthis procedure to enable use of the FOCAS detection package over almost the\nentire mosaic instead of only in the area of deepest observation where the RMS\nnoise is constant, thereby roughly doubling our areal coverage.\n  We correct the object counts in our fields for stellar contamination using\nthe SKY model of Cohen (1995) and compare the galaxy counts to those in random\nfields.

It is found that the exponentiation time-scale for isotropic\nPlummer spheres varies very little with particle number if the softening is\nsmall. Large softening on the other hand has a marked effect and, if large\nenough, can cause the curvatures to become positive. This last result confirms\nthe previous observations for self gravitating sheets and suggests that the\nqualitative behaviour of large-N and continuum systems may be different, and\nthat their equivalence is only obtained in the limit of infinite $N$ and finite\nsoftening. It is also found that the presence of a large fraction of the\nkinetic energy in rotational motion increases the exponentiation time-scales\nsignificantly --- an effect that should be expected given the regular nature of\nnearly circular motion. In the light of the results of this and of previous\nstudies, it is suggested that the exponential instability may arise from low\norder resonances between the period of the variation of the gravitational field\ndue to distant encounters and the orbital period of a test particle. For\nperiods long compared to the exponentiation time but short compared to the\ndiffusion time-scales of the action variables, the standard picture of\ncollisionless dynamics may be valid in an averaged sense. Instead it is\nsuggested that, at least for systems with well defined final states, the\nrelaxation time should scale as $\\sim N^{1/2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 1998 13:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
