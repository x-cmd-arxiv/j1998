The case $n_p=1$ corresponds to the necklace\nladder and has remarkable properties which are studied using DMRG and recurrent\nvariational ansatzes. The AF Heisenberg model on this ladder is equivalent to\nthe alternating spin-1/spin-1/2 AFH chain which is known to have a\nferrimagnetic ground state (GS). For doping 1/3 the GS is a fully doped (1,1)\nstripe with the holes located mostly along the principal diagonal while the\nminor diagonals are occupied by spin singlets. This state can be seen as a Mott\ninsulator of localized Cooper pairs on the plaquettes. A physical picture of\nour results is provided by a $t_p-J_p$ model of plaquettes coupled diagonally\nwith a hopping parameter $t_d$. In the limit $t_d \\to \\infty$ we recover the\noriginal $t-J$ model on the necklace ladder while for weak hopping parameter\nthe model is easily solvable.

We\nfocus on two systems where experimental results are available: a wide single\nand a narrow asymmetric double well. The aim is to calculate frequency and\nlinewidth of collective electronic modes damped via electron-electron\ninteraction only. Since Landau damping is not effective here, the dominant\ndamping mechanism involves dynamical exchange-correlation effects such as\nmultipair production. To capture these effects, one has to go beyond the widely\nused adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA) and include retardation. We\nperform a comparative study of two approaches which fall in this category: the\ndynamical extension of the ALDA by Gross and Kohn, and a more recent method\nwhich treats exchange and correlation beyond the ALDA as viscoelastic stresses\nin the electron liquid. We find that the former method is more robust: it\nperforms similarly for strongly different degrees of collectivity of the\nelectronic motion. Results for quantum wells compare reasonably to experiment,\nwith a tendency towards overdamping. By contrast, the viscoelastic approach is\nsuperior for systems where the electron dynamics is predominantly collective,\nbut breaks down if the local velocity field is too rapidly varying, as in the\ncase of a single-electron-like behavior such as tunneling through a potential\nbarrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 1998 22:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is shown that for some types of interatomic interaction,\nthis problem can be reduced to a differential equation of Schrodinger type,\nwhich, in some cases, can be solved in closed form. By way of example, problems\non the one dimensional chain having an initial splitting jump and on the\nspherical cluster are solved. In both cases analitical solutions are obtained,\nwhich considerably reduce the time required for calculations of one-dimensional\nsystems and permit the calculation of three-dimensional spherical clusters,\nwhereas the numerical calculation becomes impossible for the clusters with a\nradius larger than ten lattice constants. The spectra calculated for small\nsystems completely coincide with the spectra obtained by means of numerical\ndiagonalization. The proposed method may appear to be convinient for solving\nproblems related to Frenkel excitons in systems having no translation symmetry\n(disordered systems).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 1998 15:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The latter shows an\neffective confinement. At thermal equilibrium the stability is studied within\nthermodynamics (mechanical stability) and via a linear response analysis of the\nVlasov equation. The instabilities related to a first-order phase transition\nare found. For a plasma expanding in three and one dimensions far from\nequilibrium a new type of instability, called dynamical, appears.

Using this model, we obtain source parameters, including\ndepth and duration, for each of the aftershocks in the profile, and in\naddition, any significant (M>3.7) Joshua Tree--Landers aftershock between\nApril, 1992 and October, 1994 for which coherent TERRAscope data were\navailable. In all, we determine source parameters and stress-drops for 45\nsignificant (M_w > 4) earthquakes associated with the Joshua Tree and Landers\nsequences, using a waveform grid-search algorithm. Stress drops for these\nearthquakes appear to vary systematically with location, with respect to\nprevious seismic activity, proximity to previous rupture (i.e., with respect to\nthe Landers rupture), and with tectonic province. In general, for areas north\nof the Pinto Mountain fault, stress-drops of aftershocks located off the faults\ninvolved with the Landers rupture are higher than those located on the fault,\nwith the exception of aftershocks on the newly recognized Kickapoo (Landers)\nfault. Stress drops are moderate south of the Pinto Mountain fault, where there\nis a history of seismic swarms but no single through-going fault. In contrast\nto aftershocks in the eastern Transverse ranges, and related to the 1992 Big\nBear, California, sequence, Landers events show no clear relationship between\nstress-drop and depth. Instead, higher stress-drop aftershocks appear to\ncorrelate with activity on nascent faults, or those which experienced\nrelatively small slip during mainshock rupture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 1998 20:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-22"}

Multiresolution analysis of wavelet theory provides an\nefficient representation of functions which exhibit localized bursts of short\nlength-scale behavior. Applications such as computing the electrostatic field\nin and around a molecule should benefit from both approaches. In this work, we\ndemonstrate how a novel interpolating wavelet transform, which in itself is the\nsynthesis of finite element analysis and wavelet theory, may be used as the\nmathematical bridge to connect the two approaches. The result is a specialized\nmultigrid algorithm which may be applied to problems expressed in wavelet\nbases. With this approach, interpolation and restriction operators and grids\nfor the multigrid algorithm are predetermined by an interpolating\nmultiresolution analysis. We will present the new method and contrast its\nefficiency with standard wavelet and multigrid approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 1998 15:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
