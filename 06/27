Transverse momentum spectra are studied\nfor the range 0.3 GeV/c < mT-m0 < 4.0 GeV/c. The results for central collisions\nare compared to various models. The centrality dependence of the neutral pion\nspectral shape and yield is investigated. An invariance of the spectral shape\nand a simple scaling of the yield with the number of participating nucleons is\nobserved for centralities with greater than about 30 participating nucleons\nwhich is most naturally explained by assuming an equilibrated system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 1998 16:22:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 1998 09:56:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 1998 09:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-17"}

The extensive body of work at zero temperature and chemical potential\nis represented by a selection of contemporary studies that focus on solving the\nBethe-Salpeter equation, deriving an exact mass formula in QCD that describes\nlight and heavy pseudoscalar mesons simultaneously, and the calculation of the\nelectromagnetic pion form factor and the vector meson electroproduction cross\nsections. These applications emphasise the qualitative importance of the\nmomentum-dependent dressing of elementary Schwinger functions in QCD, which\nprovides a unifying connection between disparate phenomena. They provide a\nsolid foundation for an extension of the approach to nonzero temperature and\nchemical potential. The essential, formal elements of this application are\ndescribed and four contemporary studies employed to exemplify the method and\nits efficacy. They study the demarcation of the phase boundary for\ndeconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration, the calculation of bulk\nthermodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma and the response of pi- and\nrho-meson observables to T and mu. Along the way a continuum order parameter\nfor deconfinement is introduced, an anticorrelation between the response of\nmasses and decay constants to T and their response to mu elucidated, and a\n(T,mu)-mirroring of the slow approach of bulk thermodynamic quantities to their\nultrarelativistic limit highlighted. These effects too are tied to the\nmomentum-dependent dressing of the elementary Schwinger functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 1998 19:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-04"}
