With the use of multifiber spectroscopy, we\nmeasured 180 new velocities of galaxies in the central part of A3367 and in the\nexternal regions of A548.\n  The redshift histogram shows the presence of three velocity peaks, at v ~\n12000 km/s, v ~ 30000 km/s and v ~ 40000 km/s, respectively. For these we\nestimate the density excess, the mean velocity, and the velocity dispersion.\n  The first clump corresponds to an elongation of A548: in particular we found\na correspondence between the features of this peak and the substructures of\nA548. The second peak has a velocity dispersion which is typical of clusters\nand the distribution of its members on the plane of the sky corresponds to the\nhighest density peak in A3367. We therefore suggest that the name A3367 has to\nbe attributed to this clump.\n  Our general conclusion is that, differently from expected, A548 and A3367 do\nnot form a close pair of merging clusters, since the two structures are at\nsignificantly different redshifts.

Phenomenologically, it bears remarkable similarities to\n``atoll'' sources. Shortly after the onset of the outburst, the source is seen\nto be in an ``island'' state, but with little X-ray variability. It then\nappears to have made a rapid spectral transition (on a time scale less than\nhalf a day) to another ``island'' state, where it evolves slightly and stays\nfor 4 days. In this state, the observed X-ray flux becomes increasingly\nvariable as the source brightens. Quasi-period oscillation (QPO) in the X-ray\nintensity is detected in the frequency range 670--870 Hz. The QPO frequency\nincreases with the X-ray flux while its fractional rms decreases. The QPO\nbecomes undetectable following a transition to a ``banana'' state, where the\nsource continues its evolution by moving up and down the ``banana'' branch in\nthe color-color diagram as the flux (presumably, the mass accretion rate)\nfluctuates around the peak of the outburst. Throughout the entire period, the\npower density spectrum is dominated by very-low frequency noises. Little power\ncan be seen above ~1 Hz, which is different from typical ``atoll'' sources. In\nthe ``banana'' state, the overall X-ray variability remains low (with\nfractional rms ~3--4%) but roughly constant.

The current paper presents a\ntechnique for modelling the three-dimensional structure of the core by\nsimulating spectral line images of the source and comparing those images to\nobserved data. The primary conclusions of this work are that the molecular gas\nin e2 is radially contracting at about 5 km/s and that the temperature and\ndensity of the gas decrease outward over 0.15 pc scales. The simple model of\nthe collapse of the singular isothermal sphere for low-mass star formation (Shu\n1977) is an inadequate description of this high-mass molecular core; better\nmodels have temperature decreasing outward as r^-0.6, density as r^-2, and\nvelocity increasing as r^+0.1.

The method used is adapted from a\nvery general multi-lens ray-tracing technique developed by Moeller. We\ninvestigate the effects of the disk-to-halo mass ratio, the disk scale length,\nthe disk inclination to the line of sight and the lens redshift on two\nstrong-lensing cross sections: the cross section for multiple imaging, and the\ncross section for large magnifications, in excess of a factor of 10. We find\nthat the multiple-imaging cross section can be enhanced significantly by an\nalmost edge-on Milky Way disk as compared with a singular isothermal sphere\n(SIS) in individual cases; however, when averaged over all disk inclinations,\nthe cross section is only increased by about fifty per cent. These results are\nconsistent with other recent work. The presence of a disk, however, increases\nthe inclination-averaged high-magnification cross section by an order of\nmagnitude as compared with a SIS. This result has important implications for\nmagnification bias in future lens surveys, particularly those in the\nsubmillimetre waveband, where dust extinction in the lensing galaxy has no\neffect on the brightness of the images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 1998 10:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

It is shown that i) the type of gamma-ray flare\nproduced by the model is determined by the ratio of the thickness of ejected\nfluid slab and the gradient length scale of ambient radiation intensity, ii)\nthe radiative efficiency depends sensitively on the opacity contributed by the\nbackground radiation, owing to a radiative feedback, and is typically very high\nfor parameters characteristic to the powerful blazars, and iii) the emitted\nflux is strongly suppressed at energies for which the pair-production optical\ndepth is initially larger than unity; the time lag and flare duration in this\nenergy range increase with increasing gamma-ray energy.

We characterize the noise by a transfer function $T(f)\n\\equiv \\tilde x(f)/\\tilde W(f)$ from the spectrum of direction averaged ground\nmotion $\\tilde W(f)$ to the spectrum of test mass motion $\\tilde x(f) = L\\tilde\nh(f)$ (where $L$ is the length of the interferometer's arms, and $\\tilde h(f)$\nis the spectrum of gravitational-wave noise).

By analysing\nthe duality symmetry in the harmonic oscillator, we show that the massless\nscalar theory in two dimensions display, along with the expected discrete $Z_2$\nsymmetry, the continuous SO(2) symmetry as well. The same holds for the free\nMaxwell theory in four dimensions, which is usually regarded to manifest only\nthe SO(2) symmetry. This leads to the new result that, following a proper\ninterpretation, the duality groups in two and four dimensions become identical.\nIncidentally, duality in quantum mechanics is generally not covered in the\nliterature that considers only $D=4k$ or $D=4k+2$ spacetime dimensions, for\nintegral $k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 1998 12:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
