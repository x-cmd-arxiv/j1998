In order to confirm these experimental implications, we have\nused two analogues of the peptide with charged and neutral side chains of Glu-2\nand His-12. Two dielectric functions, distance-dependent and constant, are\nconsidered to study the effects of solvent contributions. All the simulations\nwere started from random initial conformations. Various thermodynamic\nquantities such as average helicity as a function of residue number and average\ndistance between two side chains as a function of temperature are calculated.\nThe results are found to be in accord with the implications of CD and NMR\nexperiments. The lowest-energy conformation obtained has an alpha-helix from\nAla-4 to Gln-11 in complete agreement with the corresponding structure deduced\nfrom an X-ray crystallography experiment of ribonuclease A. It is shown that\nthe salt bridge between the side chains of Glu-2$^-$ and Arg-10$^+$, which is\nknown to exist from both NMR and X-ray experiments, is formed only when the\nside chains are properly charged. Its formation is greatly enhanced when the\ndistance-dependent dielectric function is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 1998 04:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the limit of a low initial occupation of\nthe excited atomic state, our system is shown to possess novel atomic spectra\nand population statistics. For a high initial excited state population, mean\nfield theory suggests a fractionalized inversion and a macroscopic polarization\nfor the atoms in the steady state, both of which can be controlled by an\nexternal d.c. field. This atomic steady state is accompanied by a non--zero\nexpectation value of the electric field operators for field modes located in\nthe vicinity of the atoms. The nature of homogeneous broadening near the band\nedge is shown to differ markedly from that in free space due to non-Markovian\nmemory effects in the radiation dynamics. Non-Markovian vacuum fluctuations are\nshown to yield a partially coherent steady state polarization with a random\nphase. In contrast with the steady state of a conventional laser, near a\nphotonic band edge this coherence occurs as a consequence of photon\nlocalization in the absence of a conventional cavity mode. We also introduce a\nclassical stochastic function with the same temporal correlations as the\nelectromagnetic reservoir, in order to stochastically simulate the effects of\nvacuum fluctuations near a photonic band edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 1998 21:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
