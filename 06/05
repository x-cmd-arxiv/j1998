In\nboth cases, this linearity indicates that freshly synthesized C and O are\naccelerated by Type II supernovae and subsequently fragmented into Be and B.\nOne mechanism advocates shock acceleration in the gaseous phase of superbubbles\nexcavated by collective SNII explosions. Because of their short lifetimes, only\nthe most massive stars (with an initial mass greater than 60\\msun) do not drift\nout of superbubbles, and participate in BeB production. The second mechanism is\nbased on the acceleration of the debris of grains formed in the ejecta of all\nSNIIs (originating from stars with initial mass greater than 8\\msun). Here\nagain, fresh C and O are sped up to cosmic ray energies by shocks. We propose a\npossible test to discriminate between the two scenarios. If supernovae of all\nmasses are involved in BeB production, the Be/Fe ratio is constant, since both\nelements are produced in the same events. Alternatively, when only the most\nmassive stars are involved in Be production, Be/Fe is enhanced at very early\ntimes because of the shorter lifetimes of these stars. This predicted\ndifference in the behavior of Be/Fe could be tested by high quality\nobservations at [Fe/H] $\\lsim -3$. We also note that the solution invoking only\nthe most massive supernovae mimics a flat evolution of both Be/H and B/H as a\nfunction of Fe/H at low metallicity, and could thus resemble a \"plateau\" for\nthese elements despite a lack of a primordial Big Bang nucleosynthesis origin.\nConsequently, there may be no need to invoke inhomogeneous Big Bang models to\nexplain the initial production of BeB should a plateau be discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 1998 04:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Several routes, including the\nstandard ones by which the appearance of strange nonchaotic attractors takes\nplace, are shown to be realizable in the same model over a two parameters\n($f-\\epsilon$) domain of the system. In particular, the transition through\ntorus doubling to chaos via SNA, torus breaking to chaos via SNA and period\ndoubling bifurcations of fractal torus are demonstrated with the aid of the two\nparameter ($f-\\epsilon$) phase diagram. More interestingly, in order to\napproach the strange nonchaotic attractor, the existence of several new\nbifurcations on the torus corresponding to the novel phenomenon of torus\nbubbling are described. Particularly, we point out the new routes to chaos,\nnamely, (1) two frequency quasiperiodicity $\\to$ torus doubling $\\to$ torus\nmerging followed by the gradual fractalization of torus to chaos, (2) two\nfrequency quasiperiodicity $\\to$ torus doubling $\\to$ wrinkling $\\to$ SNA $\\to$\nchaos $\\to$ SNA $\\to$ wrinkling $\\to$ inverse torus doubling $\\to$ torus $\\to$\ntorus bubbles followed by the onset of torus breaking to chaos via SNA or\nfollowed by the onset of torus doubling route to chaos via SNA. The existence\nof the strange nonchaotic attractor is confirmed by calculating several\ncharacterizing quantities such as Lyapunov exponents, winding numbers, power\nspectral measures and dimensions. The mechanism behind the various bifurcations\nare also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 1998 02:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It has been known that the existing\nhierarchies of quark masses render this suppression at low energies rather\nnatural. On the other hand, the model has been regarded by many as unnatural\nbecause of the absence of any symmetry that would ensure persistence of this\nsuppression as the energy of probes increases. The opinion has been based on\nthe expectation that the mentioned FCNC's would increase by large factors at\nincreasing energies. We performed a numerical analysis of the flow of these FCN\ncoupling parameters as governed by the one-loop renormalization group equations\n(RGE's), in a simplified case when Yukawa couplings of the first quark\ngeneration are neglected. The analysis shows a remarkable persistence of the\nmentioned FCNC suppression and thus indicates that the model is not unnatural\nin the RGE sense.
