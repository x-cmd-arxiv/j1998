This gives, for instance, virtual moduli\ncycles in Hilbert schemes of curves in $\\Pee^3$, and Donaldson-- and\nGromov-Witten-- like invariants of Fano 3-folds. It also allows us to define\nthe holomorphic Casson invariant of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold $X$, prove it is\ndeformation invariant, and compute it explicitly in some examples. Then we\ncalculate moduli spaces of sheaves on a general $K3$ fibration $X$, enabling us\nto compute the invariant for some ranks and Chern classes, and equate it to\nGromov-Witten invariants of the ``Mukai-dual'' 3-fold for others.

As\nopposed to the usual link calculi of Kirby and others this description uses\nonly elementary, local moves(namely modifications and isolated cancellations),\nand it is valid also on non-simply connected and disconnected manifolds. In\nparticular, it allows us to give a presentation of a 3-manifold by doing\nsurgery on any other 3-manifold with the same boundary. Bridged link\npresentations on unions of handlebodies are used to give a Cerf-theoretical\nderivation of presentations of 2+1-dimensional cobordisms categories in terms\nof planar ribbon tangles and their composition rules. As an application we give\na different, more natural proof of the Matveev-Polyak presentations of the\nmapping class group, and, furthermore, find systematically surgery\npresentations of general mapping tori.

Invariance\nfollows now - similar as for knot invariants - from simple identifications of\nthe elementary moves with elementary categorial relations for invariances or\ncointegrals, respectively. Hence, we avoid the lengthy computations and the\nunnatural Fenn-Rourke reduction of the original proofs. Moreover, we are able\nto start from a much weaker ``modularity''-condition, which implies the one of\nTuraev.
