The high\nsensitivity of these two microlensing measures to the circular velocity model,\nvelocity dispersions, bulge mass, direction of the line of sight, bar axis\norientation, star spatial distribution and the stellar mass function means no\nsingle galaxy property can be constrained very well without constraining most\nof the others. The model time scale frequency distributions are compared with\nthat determined empirically by the MACHO group throughout. Although the MACHO\nempirical data are matched quite well with a nominal velocity model and with a\nmass function only of hydrogen burning stars that varies as m^{-2.2} to\nm^{-2.5} in the M star region, uncertainties in galactic structure, kinematics\nand content together with the paucity of published microlensing data preclude\nany claim of the model representing the real world. A variation of the mass\nfunction \\sim m^{-1} in the M star region obtained from recent star counts,\nboth local and in the galactic bulge, fails to yield a sufficient number of\nshort time scale events compared to the MACHO data. The high sensitivity of the\nmicrolensing measures to the direction of the line of sight may mean that\nsufficient microlensing data is already in hand to constrain the bar\ndistribution of stars. The procedure developed here for determining the time\nscale frequency distribution is particularly convenient for rapidly\nincorporating model changes as data from all sources continues to accumulate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 1998 18:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

A\ntransverse lattice regulator and colour-dielectric link fields are employed,\ntogether with an associated effective potential. We argue that the light-front\nvacuum is necessarily trivial for large enough lattice spacing, and clarify why\nthis leads to an Eguchi-Kawai dimensional reduction of observables to\n1+1-dimensions in the infinite N limit. The procedure is then tested by\nexplicit calculations for 2+1-dimensional SU(infinity) gauge theory, within a\nfirst approximation to the lattice effective potential. We identify a scaling\ntrajectory which produces Lorentz covariant behaviour for the lightest\nglueballs. The predicted masses, in units of the measured string tension, are\nin agreement with recent results from conventional Euclidean lattice\nsimulations. In addition, we obtain the potential between heavy sources and the\nstructure of the glueballs from their light-front wavefunctions. Finally, we\nbriefly discuss the extension of these calculations to 3+1-dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 1998 15:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 1998 14:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}
