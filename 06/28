With few\nexceptions, galaxies with M_V < -22 have core profiles, and galaxies with M_V >\n-20.5 have power-law profiles. Both profile types occur in galaxies with -22 <\nM_V < -20.5. We show that these results are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat: (i) all early-type galaxies have black holes (BHs) that grew\nadiabatically in homogeneous isothermal cores; and (ii) these `progenitor'\ncores followed scaling relations similar to those of the fundamental plane.\n  The models studied here are the ones first proposed by Young. Models with BH\nmasses and progenitor cores that obey established scaling relations predict (at\nVirgo) that galaxies with M_V < -21.2 have core profiles and galaxies with M_V\n> -21.2 have power-law profiles. This reproduces both the sense and the\nabsolute magnitude of the observed transition. Intrinsic scatter in BH and\ngalaxy properties can explain why both types of galaxies are observed around\nthe transition magnitude. The observed bimodality in cusp slopes may be due to\na bimodality in M_bh/L, with rapidly rotating disky galaxies having larger\nM_bh/L than slowly rotating boxy galaxies.\n  Application to individual galaxies with HST photometry yields a roughly\nlinear correlation between BH mass and V-band galaxy luminosity, log M_bh =\n-1.83 + log L (solar units). This agrees with the average relation for nearby\ngalaxies with kinematically determined BH masses, and also with predictions\nfrom quasar statistics (shortened abstract).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 1998 20:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
