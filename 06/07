All published photometry for the past three decades have been\nbased on these two calibrations, which are in error by 0.05 +- 0.01. We employ\nthe Pinsonneault etal (1998) fiducial main sequence to derive a cluster\ndistance modulus of 11.43 +- 0.08. We report observations that are >= 50%\ncomplete to V = 24.6 and find that the cluster central-field LF peaks at M_I ~\n3 to 4. This is unlike the solar neighborhood LF and unlike the LFs of\ndynamically unevolved portions of open and globular clusters, which rise\ncontinuously until M_I ~ 9.5. Although we find that >= 50% of the unresolved\ncluster objects are multiple systems, their presence cannot account for the\nshape of the NGC 188 LF. For theoretical reasons (Terlevich 1987; Vesperini &\nHeggie 1997) having to do with the survivability of NGC 188 we believe the\ncluster is highly dynamically evolved and that the missing low luminosity stars\nare either in the cluster outskirts or have left the cluster altogether. We\nidentify nine candidate WDs, of which we expect three to six are bona fide\ncluster WDs. The luminosities of the faintest likely WD indicates an age\n(Bergeron, Wesemael, & Beauchamp 1995) of 1.14 +- 0.09 Gyrs. This is a lower\nlimit to the cluster age and observations probing to V = 27 or 28 will be\nnecessary to find the faintest cluster WDs and independently determine the\ncluster age. While our age limit is not surprising for this ~6 Gyr old cluster,\nour result demonstrates the value of the WD age technique with its very low\ninternal errors.
