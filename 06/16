The appearance of\n  photoevaporating disks around young intermediate mass stars","comments":"14 pages, 13 figures, corrected Fig.8, last row","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":"x-98","categories":"astro-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  We present theoretical continuum emission spectra (SED's), isophotal maps and\nline profiles for several models of photoevaporating disks at different\norientations with respect to the observer. The hydrodynamic evolution of these\nmodels has been the topic of the two previous papers of this series. We discuss\nin detail the numerical scheme used for these diagnostic radiation transfer\ncalculations. Our results are qualitatively compared to observed ultracompact\nHii-regions (UCHii's). Our conclusion is that the high fraction of\n``unresolved'' UCHii's from the catalogues of Wood & Churchwell (1989) and\nKurtz et al. (1994) cannot be explained by disks around massive stars. In\nparticular, the observed infrared spectra of these objects indicate dust\ntemperatures which are about one order of magnitude lower than expected. We\nsuggest that disks around close companions to OB stars may be necessary to\nresolve this inconsistency. Alternatively, strong stellar winds and radiative\nacceleration could remove disk material from the immediate vicinity of luminous\nO stars, whereas for the lower luminosity sources considered here this will not\noccur. We also find that line profiles tracing the evaporated material\noriginating from the disk are not influenced significantly by the existence of\nstellar winds over a wide range of wind velocities (400 - 1000 km/s). We\ncompare our results to the bright IRAS source MWC349A. Many of its properties,\nespecially its spatial appearance in high-resolution radio maps, can be well\nexplained by a disk surrounding a UV luminous star with a high velocity stellar\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 1998 15:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 1998 10:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A resonator is characterized by a set of\nmodes, each with a resonant frequency omega and resonance width Delta\nomega=1/tau, where tau is the lifetime of a photon in the mode. In a\ncylindrical or spherical dielectric resonator, extremely long-lived resonances\nare due to `whispering gallery' modes in which light circulates around the\nperimeter trapped by total internal reflection. These resonators emit light\nisotropically. Recently, a new category of asymmetric resonant cavities (ARCs)\nhas been proposed in which substantial shape deformation leads to partially\nchaotic ray dynamics. This has been predicted to give rise to a universal,\nfrequency-independent broadening of the whispering-gallery resonances, and\nhighly anisotropic emission. Here we present solutions of the wave equation for\nARCs which confirm many aspects of the earlier ray-optics model, but also\nreveal interesting frequency-dependent effects characteristic of quantum chaos.\nFor small deformations the lifetime is controlled by evanescent leakage, the\noptical analogue of quantum tunneling. We find that the lifetime is much\nshortened by a process known as `chaos-assisted tunneling'. In contrast, for\nlarge deformations (~10%) some resonances are found to have longer lifetimes\nthan predicted by the ray chaos model due to `dynamical localization'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 1998 10:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
