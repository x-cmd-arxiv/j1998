In the\ncrystal lattice, the molecules are well separated from each other and the\nactive part of the Hamiltonian at k_B*T << J is H=-D*S_z^2, so that up and down\nspins states have identical energies, and S_z can escape from one state to the\nother via either over-the-barrier motion, or tunneling.

However, its application to turbulence faces several technical\ndifficulties, which have had to be circumvented by uncontrolled approximations.\nIndeed, in view of the deterministic nature of the Navier-Stokes equations, it\nis clear that the operation of averaging out the high-wavenumber modes while\nkeeping the low-wavenumber modes constant, cannot be done rigorously and in\nitself can only be an approximation.\n  With points like this in mind, we have recently adopted direct numerical\nsimulation as a tool for probing the basic feasibility of using RG techniques\nto reduce the number of degrees of freedom requiring to be numerically\nsimulated. In this paper, we present some of the first results of this\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 1998 12:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
