The magnification can be\ndetermined from the variation in number counts of its background galaxies. In\nthe weak lensing approximation the surface mass density is a linear function of\nthe magnification. However, most observational data is concentrated in the\ncentral parts of clusters, so one needs to go beyond the weak lensing\napproximation, and consider the lens shear as well, which is unknown from the\nvariation in number counts alone. We studied the lensing properties of a\ncatalogue of numerical cluster models in order to find the best possible\napproximation for the shear which still allows straightforward determination of\nthe surface mass density. We show that by using such an approximation one can\nfairly well reconstruct the surface mass distribution from the magnification\nalone. It is demonstrated that the mass estimated using the weak lens\nmagnification approximation is usually at least twice the true mass.

Instead, the relative size of disk and halo, or alternatively,\nthe ratio of circular velocity to local escape speed at the half mass radius of\nthe disk are more useful criteria.
