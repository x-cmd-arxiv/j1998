This combination provides the most accurate proper\nmotions available at present. There are two main reasons why the ground-based\nobservations are able to improve the HIPPARCOS proper motions considerably: (1)\nThe lower positional accuracy of the ground-based observations is compensated\nby a much longer period of observations, covering more than 200 years for most\nFK6 stars; (2) Due to undetected astrometric binaries, the HIPPARCOS proper\nmotions, measured 'instantaneously' during a period of about 3 years only, can\ndeviate significantly from the long-term proper motions, while the ground-based\nresults of the FK5 provide already fairly 'time- averaged' data. Hence the\nground-based results allow to identify and to correct, at least partially,\n'cosmic errors' in the HIPPARCOS proper motions. The proper motions of the FK6,\nand hence the positions predicted from the FK6 data, are significantly more\naccurate than the data given in the HIPPARCOS Catalogue and in the FK5. For\ntruly single stars, the accuracy is improved by a factor of about 2 by the FK6.\nFor the ensemble of apparently single stars, in which the HIPPARCOS proper\nmotions suffer from cosmic errors due to undetected astrometric binaries, the\ngain is even higher, by a factor of more than 4. Double stars pose special\nproblems which are handled rather individually in the FK6.

We study the precessional spin dynamics of the Heisenberg pyrochlore\nantiferromagnet. There is no freezing transition or selection of preferred\nstates. Instead, the relaxation time at low temperature, T, is of order\nhbar/(k_B T). We argue that this behaviour can also be expected in some other\nsystems, including the Heisenberg model for the compound SrCr_8Ga_4O_{19}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 1998 15:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The pluricomplex Green function with a\nsingle logarithmic pole or a finite number of weighted poles is a very special\ncase of our construction. We give several equivalent definitions of this\nfunction and study its properties, including boundary behaviour, continuity,\nand uniqueness. This is based on and extends our previous work on disc\nfunctionals and their envelopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 1998 12:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One can see the very large sensitivity of all the observables, especialy\nof the polarization characteristics to the choice of the DWF form.
