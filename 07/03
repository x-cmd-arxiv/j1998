Since the evolutionary timescales of LMXBs, their progenitors, and their\ndescendants are thought be significant fractions of the time-interval between\nthe SFR peak and the present epoch, there is a lag in the turn-on of the LMXB\npopulation, with the peak activity occurring at z ~ 0.5 - 1.0. The peak in the\nMRP population is delayed further, occurring at z < 0.5. We show that the\ndiscrepancy between the birthrate of LMXBs and MRPs, found under the assumption\nof a stead-state SFR, can be resolved for the population as a whole when the\neffects of a time-variable SFR are included. A discrepancy may persist for\nLMXBs with short orbital periods, although a detailed population synthesis will\nbe required to confirm this. Further, since the integrated X-ray luminosity\ndistribution of normal galaxies is dominated by X-ray binaries, it should show\nstrong luminosity evolution with redshift. In addition to an enhancement near\nthe peak (z ~ 1.5) of the SFR due to the prompt turn-on of the relatively\nshort-lived massive X-ray binaries and young supernova remnants, we predict a\nsecond enhancement by a factor ~10 at a redshift between ~ 0.5 and ~ 1 due to\nthe delayed turn-on of the LMXB population. Deep X-ray observations of galaxies\nout to z ~ 1 by AXAF will be able to observe this enhancement, and, by\ndetermining its shape as a function of redshift, will provide an important new\nmethod for constraining evolutionary models of X-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 1998 16:07:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 1998 21:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Two\nalternative types of boundary condition applicable to quantum field theory or\nquantum gravity are contrasted. The first is the `coordinate' boundary\ncondition as used in quantum cosmology; the second type is scattering boundary\nconditions, as used in Feynman diagrams, applicable to asymptotically flat\nspace-time. The first yields a differential-equation form of the theory, dual\nto the integral version appropriate to the second. Here, the first (Dirac)\napproach is found to be extremely streamlined for the calculation of loop\namplitudes in these locally supersymmetric theories. By contrast,\nFeynman-diagram methods have led to calculations which are typically so large\nas to be unmanageable. Remarkably, the Riemannian quantum amplitude for\ncoordinate boundary conditions in $N = 1$ supergravity (without matter) is\nexactly semi-classical, being of the form $exp(-I/\\hbar)$, where $I$ is the\nclassical action, allowing for the presence of fermions as well as gravity on\nthe boundaries.

By taking into\naccount field-field correlations and field-dipole correlations, the QMBE\ninclude quantum noise effects which cause spontaneous emission and amplified\nspontaneous emission. In particular, the source of spontaneous emission is\nobtained by factorizing the dipole-dipole correlations into a product of\nelectron and hole densities. The QMBE are formulated for general devices, for\nedge emitting lasers and for vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, providing\na starting point for the detailed analysis of spatial coherence in the near\nfield and far field patterns of such laser diodes. Analytical expressions are\ngiven for the spectra of gain and spontaneous emission described by the QMBE.\nThese results are applied to the case of a broad area laser, for which the\nfrequency and carrier density dependent spontaneous emission factor beta and\nthe evolution of the far field pattern near threshold are derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 1998 13:15:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 1998 10:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
