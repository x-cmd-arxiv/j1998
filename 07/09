In the present work, we investigate the\nyoung stellar population of the cloud using the IJK photometric DENIS data. The\nwhole sample of 126 already known YSOs, which are mainly T Tauri stars, are\nidentified in the DENIS catalogue. Besides, we propose 54 sources as new\ncandidates of YSOs. These new faint objects are selected according to their\nextremely red near infrared colour, that cannot be explained only by the\nreddening of the cloud. Moreover they are concentrated near to the most\nobscured areas of the cloud. Although spectroscopic confirmation is badly\nrequested, they are interpreted as probable classical T Tauri stars that have\nescaped previous spectroscopic, IRAS or X-ray observations and pertaining to\nthe low-end of the luminosity function. Assuming that they are reliable YSOs\nwith massive accretion disks, and using theoretical pre-main-sequence tracks we\nestimate the age of this sample to be ranging from 5 10^5 to 4 10^6 years, an\nelapse of time that spans the range between the end of the star formation in\nthe cloud and the maximum life time of the circumstellar disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 1998 16:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We have estimated the fraction of\niron locked into dust grains to convert the observed [N/Fe] ratios into overall\n(dust plus gas) relative abundances, [N/Fe]corr. The ratios [N/alpha] have been\nmostly determined by using sulphur as a tracer of alpha-elements which is\nunaffected by dust. The [N/Fe] and [N/alpha] ratios show high dispersions, of\none order of magnitude or more, which have no equivalent in other\nelement-to-element ratios in DLAs.

Rotation\ncurve shape is a strong function of galaxy surface brightness: low-surface\nbrightness galaxies (LSBs) have slowly rising rotation curves while in\nhigh-surface brightness systems the rotation speed rises sharply and stays flat\nor even declines beyond the optical radius. These observations are consistent\nwith NFW halo profiles, with the possible exception of a few LSBs where the\nrotation curves are better described by shallower central density profiles.\nConsistency with observational trends requires that halos have lower\ncharacteristic densities than expected in the standard biased cold dark matter\n(CDM) scenario, but roughly compatible with COBE-normalized, low-density, flat\nCDM universes. The data also imply that disk mass-to-light ratios increase\ngently with luminosity, and that the halo circular velocity, V_200, is not\ndirectly proportional to the disk rotation speed, V_rot. Slowly rotating disks\nare surrounded by halos of higher circular velocities, whereas faster rotators\n(V_rot > 150 km/s) are all surrounded by halos of similar mass, corresponding\nto V_200 ~ 200 km/s. We speculate that this is because the efficiency of\nassembly of baryons into galaxies is high in massive halos, leading to disks\ntoo massive to be stable in systems that exceed the ``critical'' V_200 ~ 200\nkm/s. This modeling also provides a natural explanation for the distribution of\nsizes and rotation speeds of disk galaxies.

Within the closed-time\npath-integral formalism we include dissipation by coupling the system to a set\nof independent harmonic oscillators that mimic a quantum thermal bath. After\nintegrating over the bath variables and averaging over disorder we obtain an\neffective action that determines the real-time dynamics of the system. The\nclassical limit yields the Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functional associated\nto a colored noise. We apply this general formalism to a prototype model\nrelated to the $p$ spin-glass. We show that the model has a dynamic phase\ntransition separating the paramagnetic from the spin-glass phase and that\nquantum fluctuations depress the transition temperature until a quantum\ncritical point is reached. We show that the dynamics in the paramagnetic phase\nis stationary but presents an interesting crossover from a region controlled by\nthe classical critical point to another one controlled by the quantum critical\npoint. The most characteristic property of the dynamics in a glassy phase,\nnamely aging, survives the quantum fluctuations. In the sub-critical region the\nquantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem is modified in a way that is consistent\nwith the notion of effective temperatures introduced for the classical case. We\ndiscuss these results in connection with recent experiments in dipolar quantum\nspin-glasses and the relevance of the effective temperatures with respect to\nthe understanding of the low temperature dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 1998 14:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The charge carried by the packet (in the\nsense of the amount of \"stuff\" carried by the Klein--Gordon field) is not\nconserved in the non--local region and rapidly decreases to zero as time\ndecreases. Read in the forward temporal direction, the non--local region thus\nis the seat of production of the Hawking particle and its partner. The KMM\nmodel was inspired by string theory for which the mutilated commutator has been\nproposed to describe an effective theory of high momentum scattering of zero\nmass modes. It is here interpreted in terms of dissipation which gives rise to\nthe Hawking particle into a reservoir of other modes (of as yet unknown\norigin). On this basis it is conjectured that the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy\nfinds its origin in the fluctuations of fields extending over the non local\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 1998 09:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
