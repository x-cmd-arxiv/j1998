The lens is\na binary. We resolve the caustic crossing and find that the source took 2 Delta\nt = 8.5 hours to transit the caustic. We measure the source temperature\nT_eff=8000 K both spectroscopically and from the color (V-I)_0~0.22. We find\ntwo acceptable binary-lens models. In the first, the source crosses the caustic\nat phi=43.2 deg and the unmagnified source magnitude is I_s=22.15. The angle\nimplies that the lens crosses the source radius in time t_* = Delta t sin phi =\n2.92 hours. The magnitude (together with the temperature) implies that the\nangular radius of the source is theta_* = 0.089 micro-arsec. Hence, the proper\nmotion is mu=theta_*/t_*=1.26 km/s/kpc.\n  For the second solution, the corresponding parameters are phi=30.6 deg,\nI_s=21.81, t_*=2.15 hours, theta_* = 0.104 micro-asrsec, mu=2.00 km/s/kpc. Both\nproper-motion estimates are slower than 99.5% of the proper motions expected\nfor halo lenses. Both are consistent with an ordinary binary lens moving at ~\n75-120 km/s within the SMC itself.

This in turn reinforces the ideas of the left-right symmetric\ngauge structure $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ as well as SU(4)-color, for which the\nRH neutrinos are a compelling feature. It is noted that by assuming (a) that\nB-L and $I_{3R}$, contained in a string-derived $G(224) = SU(2)_L \\times\nSU(2)_R \\times SU(4)^c$ or SO(10), break near the GUT-scale, as opposed to an\nintermediate scale, (b) the see-saw mechanism, and (c) the SU(4)-color relation\nbetween the Dirac mass of the tau neutrino and $m_{top}$, one obtains a mass\nfor $\\nu^\\tau_L$ which is just about what is observed. This is assuming that\nthe SK group is actually seeing $\\nu^\\mu_L - \\nu^\\tau_L$ (rather than\n$\\nu_L^\\mu - \\nu_X$) oscillation. Following a very recent work by Babu, Wilczek\nand myself, it is furthermore noted that one can quite plausibly obtain a large\n$\\nu_L^\\mu-\\nu_L^\\tau$ oscillation angle, as observed, in spite of highly\nnon-degenerate masses of the light neutrinos: e.g. with\n$m(\\nu_L^\\mu)/m(\\nu_L^\\tau)\\approx 1/10-1/20$.
