We report here the discovery of two\ninteractions with companion dwarf galaxies that substantially change this\npicture. First, a faint ring structure is discovered around this galaxy that is\nlikely due to the tidal disruption of a companion dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The\nring is elliptical in shape with the center of NGC5907 close to one of the\nring's foci. This suggests the ring material is in orbit around NGC5907. No\ngaseous component to the ring has been detected either with deep H$\\alpha$\nimages or in Very Large Array (VLA) HI 21-cm line maps. The visible material in\nthe ring has an integrated luminosity <= 10^8 L_sun and its brightest part has\na color R-I ~ 0.9. All of these properties are consistent with the ring being a\ntidally-disrupted dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Second, we find that NGC5907 has a\ndwarf companion galaxy, PGC54419, projected to be only 36.9 kpc from the center\nof NGC5907, close in radial velocity (\\Delta V = 45 km s^{-1}) to the giant\nspiral galaxy.

These results, coupled\nwith the finding by others that dwarf galaxies tend to be found around giant\ngalaxies, suggest that tidal interaction with companions, even if containing a\nmere 1% of the mass of the parent galaxy, might be sufficient to excite the\nwarps found in the disks of many large spiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 1998 18:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The character of anisotropy suggests that\nthe cosmological origin of short GRBs further holds, and there is no evidence\nfor their Galactical origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 1998 15:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A full\nstudy has been done for spherical particles with a +-20% size distribution.\nStick-slip motion due to repetitive fluidization of the layer occurs for low\ndriving velocities. Between major slip events, slight creep occurs that is\nvariable from one event to the next. The effects of changing the stiffness k\nand velocity V of the driving system are studied in detail. The stick-slip\nmotion is almost periodic for spherical particles over a wide range of\nparameters, but becomes irregular when k is large and V is relatively small. At\nlarger V, the motion becomes smoother and is affected by the inertia of the\nupper plate bounding the layer. Measurements of the period T and amplitude A of\nthe relative motion are presented as a function of V. At a critical value Vc, a\ntransition to continuous sliding motion occurs that is discontinuous for k not\ntoo large. The time dependence of the instantaneous velocity of the upper plate\nand the frictional force produced by the granular layer are determined within\nindividual slipping events. The force is a multi-valued function of the\ninstantaneous velocity, with pronounced hysteresis and a sudden drop prior to\nresticking. Measurements of vertical displacement reveal a small dilation of\nthe material (about one tenth of the mean particle size in a layer 20 particles\ndeep) associated with each slip event. Finally, optical imaging reveals that\nlocalized microscopic rearrangements precede (and follow) each slip event. The\nbehavior of smooth particles is contrasted with that of rough particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 1998 15:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A generic condition is presented for\nerror-less quantum computation: decoherence-free subspaces are spanned by those\nstates which are annihilated by all the generators. It is shown that these\nsubspaces are stable to perturbations and moreover, that universal quantum\ncomputation is possible within them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 1998 12:10:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 1998 02:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

They arise already in a single-spin system and at the level of the\n\"classical action\" not to speak of fluctuations around the \"classical path\".\nSimilar difficulties turn out to be present in the case of the\n(boson-)coherent-state path integral as well; although partially circumventable\nby an ingenious trick (Klauder's $\\epsilon$-prescription) at the \"classical\nlevel\", they manifest themselves at the level of fluctuations. Detailed\nanalysis of the origin of these difficulties makes it clear that the only way\nof avoiding them is to work with the proper discrete-time formalism. The thesis\nis explicitly illustrated with a harmonic oscillator and a spin under a\nconstant magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 1998 13:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
