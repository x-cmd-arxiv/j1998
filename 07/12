The 6 cm light curve data from 1995-1997 and the 4 cm data from\n1990-1997 are reported here. At 4 cm, the intrinsic source variations occur\nearlier and are twice as large as the corresponding variations at 6 cm. The\nVLBI core and jet components have different magnification factors, leading to\ndifferent flux ratios for the varying and non-varying portions of the VLA light\ncurves. Using both the PRHQ and Dispersion statistical techniques, we\ndetermined the time delay, core flux ratio, and excess non-varying B image flux\ndensity. The fits were performed for the 4 cm and 6 cm light curves, both\nindividually and jointly, and we used Gaussian Monte Carlo data to estimate 68%\nstatistical confidence levels. The delay estimates from each individual\nwavelength were inconsistent given the formal uncertainties, suggesting that\nthere are unmodeled systematic errors in the analysis. We roughly estimate the\nsystematic uncertainty in the joint result from the difference between the 6 cm\nand 4 cm results, giving 409+-30 days for the PRHQ statistic and 397+-20 days\nfor the Dispersion statistic. These results are consistent with the current\noptical time delay of 417+-3 days, reconciling the long-standing difference\nbetween the optical and radio light curves and between different statistical\nanalyses. The unmodeled systematic effects may also corrupt light curves for\nother lenses, and we caution that multiple events at multiple wavelengths may\nbe necessary to determine an accurate delay in any lens system. Now that\nconsensus has been reached regarding the time delay in the 0957+561 system, the\nmost pressing issue remaining for determining H_0 is a full understanding of\nthe mass distribution in the lens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 1998 20:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

This is accomplished by the\npresence of $n \\geq 2$ new dimensions of sub-millimeter size, with the SM\nfields localised on a 3-brane in the higher dimensional space. In this paper we\nsystematically study the experimental viability of this scenario. Constraints\narise both from strong quantum gravitational effects at the TeV scale, and more\nimportantly from the production of massless higher dimensional gravitons with\nTeV suppressed couplings. Theories with $n>2$ are safe due mainly to the\ninfrared softness of higher dimensional gravity.
