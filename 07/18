Most analyses of these tests treat\nthe problem in terms of a luminosity function and its evolution which can lead\nto incorrect conclusions when dealing with high redshift sources. We develop a\nproper treatment in three parts. In the first part we describe these tests\nbased on the isophotal values of the quantities such as flux, size or surface\nbrightness. We show the shortcomings of the simple point source approximation\nbased solely on the luminosity function and consideration of the flux limit. We\nemphasize the multivariate nature of the problem and quantify the effects of\nother selection biases due to the surface brightness and angular size\nlimitations. In these considerations the surface brightness profile plays a\ncritical role. In the second part we show that considerable simplification over\nthe complicated isophotal scheme is achieved if these test are carried out in\nsome sort of metric scheme, for example that suggested by Petrosian (1976).\nThis scheme, however, is limited to well resolved sources. Finally, we describe\nthe new tests, which use the data to a fuller extent than the isophotal or\nmetric based tests, and amount to simply counting the pixels or adding their\nintensities as a function of the pixel surface brightness, instead of dealing\nwith surface brightness, sizes and fluxes of individual galaxies. We show that\nthe data analysis and its comparison with the theoretical models of the\ndistributions and evolution of galaxies has the simplicity of the metric test\nand utilizes the data more fully than the isophotal test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 1998 21:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Using the solution we\ncalculate a pion decay constant from a generalized version of Pagels-Stokar\nformula. Chiral phase transition point is determined by analyzing an effective\npotential for the quark propagator. We find solutions for which chiral symmetry\nis broken while the value of the effective potential is larger than that for\nthe chiral symmetric vacuum. These solutions correspond to meta-stable states,\nand the chiral symmetric vacuum is energetically favored. We present a phase\ndiagram on the general temperature--chemical potential plane, and show that\nphase transitions are of first order in wide range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 1998 17:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-17"}
