We find that the distribution of density in\na star's ejecta depends on whether its outer envelope is radiative or\nconvective, and if convective, on the composition structure of the star; simple\napproximate forms are presented for red and blue supergiant ejecta. Our models\nare most accurate for the high-velocity ejecta from the periphery of a star,\nwhere the shock dynamics are predictable. We present formulae for the final\ndensity distribution of this material, for both radiative and efficiently\nconvective envelopes. These formulae limit to the well-known planar,\nself-similar solutions for mass shells approaching the stellar surface. But,\nthe assumption of adiabatic flow fails at low optical depth, so this planar\nlimit need not be attained.

We give here a short review of the\nstatistical mechanical (and field theoretical) approach developed by us. We\nconsider a non-relativistic self-gravitating gas in thermal equilibrium at\ntemperature T inside a volume V. The statistical mechanics of such system has\nspecial features and, as is known, the thermodynamical limit does not exist in\nits customary form. Moreover, the treatments through microcanonical, canonical\nand grand canonical ensembles yield different results.We present here for the\nfirst time the equation of state for the self-gravitating gas in the canonical\nensemble. We find that it has the form p = [N T/ V] f(eta), where p is the\npressure, N is the number of particles and \\eta \\equiv {G m^2 N \\over V^{1/3}\nT}. The N \\to\\infty and V \\to\\infty limit exists keeping \\eta fixed. We compute\nthe function f(\\eta) using Monte Carlo simulations and for small eta\nanalytically.

We reproduce the well-known gravitational phase transition associated\nto the Jeans' instability. Namely, a gaseous phase for eta < eta_c and a\ncondensed phase for eta > eta_c. Moreover, we derive the precise behaviour of\nthe physical quantities near the transition. In particular, the pressure\nvanishes as p \\sim(eta_c-eta)^B with B \\sim 0.2 and eta_c \\sim 1.6 and the\nenergy fluctuations diverge as \\sim(eta_c-eta)^{B-1}. The speed of sound\ndecreases monotonically and approaches the value sqrt{T/6} at the transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 1998 14:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In the long-distance scale, the contribution\nof off-diagonal gluons to the Wilson loop cancels each other and exhibits a\nperimeter law behavior, which leads to exact abelian dominance on the string\ntension if the finite size effect of the Wilson loop is removed. We investigate\nthe appearance of the monopole in the QCD vacuum, considering the role of\noff-diagonal gluons. The monopole carries a large fluctuation of the gluon\nfield and provides a large abelian action in abelian projected QCD. Due to the\npartial cancellation between the abelian part and the off-diagonal part of the\nQCD action, the monopole can appear in QCD without large cost of the QCD\naction. The off-diagonal gluon is necessary for existence of the monopole at\nthe short-distance scale.
