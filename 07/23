Both problems can be reduced\nto solving an effective one-dimensional Schrodinger equation with a potential\nbarrier. In the electric field case, the potential is that of an inverted\noscillator -x^2 while in the case of Schwarchild-like spacetimes, the potential\nis of the form -1/x^2 near the horizon. The transmission and reflection\ncoefficients can easily be obtained for both potentials. To describe particle\nproduction, these coefficients have to be suitably interpreted. In the case of\nthe electric field, the standard Bogoliubov coefficients can be identified and\nthe standard gauge invariant result is recovered. However, for\nSchwarzchild-like spacetimes, such a tunnelling interpretation appears to be\ninvalid. The Bogoliubov coefficients cannot be determined by using an\nidentification process similar to that invoked in the case of the electric\nfield. The reason for such a discrepancy appears to be that, in the tunnelling\nmethod, the effective potential near the horizon is singular and symmetric. We\nalso provide a new and simple semi-classical method of obtaining Hawking's\nresult in the (t,r) co-ordinate system of the usual standard Schwarzchild\nmetric. We give a prescription whereby the singularity at the horizon can be\nregularised with Hawking's result being recovered. This regularisation\nprescription contains a fundamental asymmetry that renders both sides of the\nhorizon dissimilar. Finally, we attempt to interpret particle production by the\nelectric field as a tunnelling process between the two sectors of the Rindler\nmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 1998 06:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

By\nanalogy with disordered electrons in metals, we show that the diffusion\nconstant for light quarks in QCD is $D=2F_{\\pi}^2/|\\la\\bar{q}q\\to|$ which is\nabout 0.22 fm. We comment on the correspondence between the diffusive phase and\nthe chiral phase as described by chiral perturbation theory, as well as the\ncross-over to the ergodic phase as described by random matrix theory. The\ncross-over is identified with the Thouless energy $E_c=D/\\sqrt{V_4}$ which is\nthe inverse diffusion time in an Euclidean four-volume $V_4$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 1998 16:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
