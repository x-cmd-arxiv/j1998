In this\nmetaphor, biological populations diverge along connected clusters of well-fit\ngenotypes in a multidimensional adaptive landscape and become reproductively\nisolated species when they come to be on opposite sides of a ``hole'' in the\nadaptive landscape. No crossing of any adaptive valleys is required. I\nformulate and study a series of simple models describing the dynamics of\nspeciation on holey adaptive landscapes driven by mutation and random genetic\ndrift. Unlike most previous models that concentrate only on some stages of\nspeciation, the models studied here describe the complete process of speciation\nfrom initiation until completion. The evolutionary factors included are\nselection (reproductive isolation), random genetic drift, mutation,\nrecombination, and migration. In these models, pre- and post-mating\nreproductive isolation is a consequence of cumulative genetic change. I study\npossibilities for speciation according to allopatric, parapatric, peripatric\nand vicariance scenarios. The analytic theory satisfactorily matches results of\nindividual-based simulations reported by Gavrilets et al. (1998). It is\ndemonstrated that rapid speciation including simultaneous emergence of several\nnew species is a plausible outcome of the evolutionary dynamics of subdivided\npopulations. I consider effects of population size, population subdivision, and\nlocal adaptation on the dynamics of speciation. I briefly discuss some\nimplications of the dynamics on holey adaptive landscapes for molecular\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 1998 19:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A comparison of the\nconcentration-local density relation in clusters and the field shows that the\ntwo connect rather smoothly at the intermediate density regime, implying that\nthe apparent cluster/field difference is only a manifestation of the variation\nwith the local density.

For this type of laser, the cavity round-trip time is much\nshorter than its fluorescence time, yielding a dimensionless ratio of time\nscales $\\sigma \\ll 1$. Analytical criteria are derived for the existence,\nstability, and bifurcations of phase-locked states. We find three distinct\nunlocking mechanisms. First, if the dimensionless detuning $\\Delta$ and\ninjection strength $k$ are small in the sense that $k = O(\\Delta) \\ll\n\\sigma^{1/2}$, unlocking occurs by a saddle-node infinite-period bifurcation.\nThis is the classic unlocking mechanism governed by the Adler equation: after\nunlocking occurs, the phases of the drive and the laser drift apart\nmonotonically. The second mechanism occurs if the detuning and the drive\nstrength are large: $k =O(\\Delta) \\gg \\sigma^{1/2}$. In this regime, unlocking\nis caused instead by a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, leading first to phase\ntrapping and only then to phase drift as the drive is decreased. The third and\nmost interesting mechanism occurs in the distinguished intermediate regime $k,\n\\Delta = O(\\sigma^{1/2})$. Here the system exhibits complicated, but\nnonchaotic, behavior. Furthermore, as the drive decreases below the unlocking\nthreshold, numerical simulations predict a novel self-similar sequence of\nbifurcations whose details are not yet understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 1998 21:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Zeitschr.} {\\bf 42}, 263 (1937)) is\ngeneralized and used to numerically invert the one-sided Laplace transform\n${\\hat C}(\\beta)$. The necessary input is only the values of ${\\hat C}(\\beta)$\non the positive real axis. The method is applicable provided that the functions\n$\\hat{C}(\\beta)$ belong to the function space $L^2_\\alpha$ defined by the\ncondition that $ G(x) = e^{x\\alpha}\\hat{C}(e^x),~ \\alpha > 0$ has to be square\nintegrable. This space includes sums of exponential decays ${\\hat\nC}(\\beta)=\\sum_n^{\\infty}a_n e^{-\\beta E_n}$, e.g. partition functions with\n$a_n = 1$. In practice, the inversion algorithm consists of two subsequent fast\nFourier transforms. High accuracy inverted data can be obtained, provided that\nthe signal is also highly accurate. The method is demonstrated for a harmonic\npartition function and resonant transmission through a barrier. We find\naccurately inverted functions even in the presence of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 1998 13:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This is typically done by using a radiofrequency (rf) field that\nadiabatically couples trapped and untrapped internal atomic states for atoms\nwith kinetic energies above a value set by the field frequency. The rf-field\ncan also induce nonadiabatic changes of internal atomic spin states (F,M) that\nlead to heating and enhanced loss of atoms. In this paper we use wave packet\nsimulations to show that the evaporation process can induce these nonadiabatic\ntransitions which change the internal spin state of doubly spin-polarized (2,2)\ntrapped atoms. We also verify the validity of a multistate Landau-Zener model\nin describing the nonadiabatic dynamics. In addition, we calculate exchange\nrelaxation rate coefficients for collisions between atoms in the (2,M) states\nof 23-Na atoms. Large exchange relaxation coefficients for 23-Na as compared to\n87-Rb F=2 suggest that evaporative cooling of (2,2) Na will be more difficult\nthan for the corresponding state of Rb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 1998 13:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
