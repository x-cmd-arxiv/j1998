In the zero-replica limit several coupling constants\nhave thus to be considered, instead of just one. As a result we had found that\nthere is no stable fixed point in the vicinity of dimension six. It is natural\nto reconsider the problem in a dynamical framework, which does not require\nreplicas, although the equilibrium properties should be recovered in the large\ntime limit. Singularities in the zero-replica limit are a priori not visible in\na dynamical picture. In this note we show that in fact new interactions are\nalso generated in the stochastic approach. Similarly these interactions are\nfound to be singular below dimension eight. These critical singularities\nrequire the introduction of a time origin $t_0$ at which initial data are\ngiven. The dynamical properties are thus dependent upon the waiting time. It is\nshown here that one can indeed find a complete correspondence between the\nequilibrium singularities in the $n=0$ limit, and the singularities in the\ndynamics when the initial time $t_0$ goes to minus infinity, with $n$ replaced\nby $-\\frac{1}{t_0}$.

The basic object of the\nstudy is the correlation function of the nucleon interpolating field, where the\nmatrix element is taken with respect to the one-nucleon state. The dispersion\nintegral of the correlation function around the nucleon threshold is\ninvestigated in detail. It turns out that the integral can be identified as a\nmeasure of the nucleon-nucleon interaction strength, which is proportional to\nthe scattering length in the small scattering length limit and to one half of\nthe effective range in the large scattering length limit. New operators must be\ntaken into account in the OPE of the correlation function. There behavior\noperators do not vanish when the matrix element is taken with respect to the\nspin-nonaveraged one-nucleon state. The Wilson coefficients of such operators\nare calculated. The sum rules obtained in this manner relate the spin-dependent\nnucleon-nucleon interaction strengths with the spin-dependent nucleon matrix\nelements of the quark-gluon composite operators. The sum rules imply that the\ninteraction is stronger in the spin-triplet channel than in the spin-singlet\nchannel, but that the spin-dependence of the nucleon-nucleon interactions is\nrather small. In the spin-singlet channel the calculated strength is in\nqualitative agreement with the empirical strength, which is estimated by the\nempirical low energy scattering observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 1998 06:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
