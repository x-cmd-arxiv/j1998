This\nnew algebra allows to give a simple proof of the fact that the non crossing\nhalf-planar diagrams give the dominating contribution in a weak coupling regime\nand to calculate explicitly the correlations associated to the new algebra.

Whereas \\cite{toek1} states that the behavior\nof different observables as a function of the fragment multiplicity excludes a\nthermal origin of the fragments in \\cite{po} it has been argued that data show\na first order phase transition between a liquid and a gaseous phase.
