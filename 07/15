A WZNW model is a sigma model\nwhose classical fields are applications from a bidimensional space-time (a\nRiemann surface in the euclidian case) to a Lie group, the target space. We\nconstruct (and we compute in genus zero and one) the metric connection, called\nthe Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard (KZB) connection, on the bundle of conformal\nblocks of the WZNW model. The KZB connection may be viewed as a quantization of\nHitchin integrable systems whose configuration space is the moduli space of\nprincipal holomorphic bundles over a Riemann surface and whose phase space is\nthe (holomorphic) cotangent bundle to the configuration space. For these\nsystems, we construct explicitly a complete familly of Hamiltonians in\ninvolution in genus zero, one and two, with (complex) group SL(2) for the last\ncase. The main result is the self-duality property of the Hitchin system at\ngenus two, that is the invariance of the Hamiltonians with respect to the\ninterchange of positions and momenta in the phase space. We finally realize the\n(geometric) quantization of the Hitchin systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 1998 15:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
