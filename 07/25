We obtain a good 7 parameter fit (including a secondary\nreggeon contribution) to data taken at HERA by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations.\nThe main characteristic features of the model in reproducing the data are\ndiscussed, namely the effective pomeron intercept, the scaling violations and\nthe beta dependence. A difference obtained in the separate H1 and ZEUS fits\nleads us to analyse directly the differences between both measurements.\nPredictions on R, the ratio of longitudinal to transverse photon cross sections\nare performed and lead to very large values at high beta and large virtuality Q\nwhich may lead to a discrimination between models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 1998 16:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

CP being a spontaneously broken symmetry could provide an\nelegant solution. However, such models have difficulty making themselves\ncompatible with low-energy supersymmetry, which is popularly accepted as the\nsolution to the hierarchy problem. We demonstrate that a certain class of low\nscale supersymmetric ``Nelson-Barr'' type models can solve the strong and\nsupersymmetric CP problems while at the same time generating sufficient weak CP\nviolation in the $K^{0}-\\bar{K}^{0}$ system. Gauge-mediated supersymmetry\nbreaking is used to provide the needed squark mass degeneracies and $A$-term\nproportionalities; though that proves to be still insufficient for a generic\nNelson-Barr model. The workable model we consider here, essentially a\nsupersymmetric version of the aspon model, has the Nelson-Barr mass texture\nenforced by a U(1) gauge symmetry, broken at the TeV scale. The resulting model\nis predictive with rich phenomenology soon to be available.
