The geometric\nparameter that is measured is f(z) = H(z) D(z)/c, where H(z) is the Hubble\nconstant and D(z) the angular diameter distance at redshift z. The correlation\nfunction is computed in linear theory. We describe a method to measure it from\nobservations with the Gaussianization procedure of Croft et al (1998) to map\nthe Lya forest transmitted flux to an approximation of the linear density\nfield. The effect of peculiar velocities on the shape of the recovered power\nspectrum is pointed out.

On small scales, where the correlation function\nis higher, f(z) should be measurable with fewer quasars, but non-linear effects\nmust then be taken into account.

We show how a projective class leads to an Adams spectral sequence and\ngive some results on the convergence and collapsing of this spectral sequence.\nWe use this to study various ideals. In the stable homotopy category we examine\nphantom maps, skeletal phantom maps, superphantom maps, and ghosts. (A ghost is\na map which induces the zero map of homotopy groups.) We show that ghosts lead\nto a stable analogue of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space, and we\ncalculate this stable analogue for low-dimensional real projective spaces. We\nalso give a relation between ghosts and the Hopf and Kervaire invariant\nproblems. In the case of A-infinity modules over an A-infinity ring spectrum,\nthe ghost spectral sequence is a universal coefficient spectral sequence. From\nthe phantom projective class we derive a generalized Milnor sequence for\nfiltered diagrams of finite spectra, and from this it follows that the group of\nphantom maps from X to Y can always be described as a lim^1 group. The last two\nsections focus on algebraic examples. In the derived category of an abelian\ncategory we study the ideal of maps inducing the zero map of homology groups\nand find a natural setting for a result of Kelly on the vanishing of composites\nof such maps.

Detailed\napplications to completely integrable systems, including the KdV, AKNS, Toda,\nand the combined sine-Gordon and mKdV hierarchies, are made. These\ninvestigations uncover a new principle for 1+1-dimensional integrable soliton\nequations in the sense that the Dubrovin equations, combined with appropriate\ntrace formulas, encode all hierarchies of soliton equations associated with\nhyperelliptic curves. In other words, completely integable hierarchies of\nsoliton equations determine Dubrovin equations and associated trace formulas\nand, vice versa, Dubrovin-type equations combined with trace formulas permit\nthe construction of hierarchies of soliton equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 1998 08:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
