Moreover, it is a technique whereby the difficulties\nassociated with performing parametric integrals in the standard approach are\ntransferred to a simpler solving of a system of linear algebraic equations,\nthanks to the polynomial character of the relevant integrands. We employ this\nmethod to evaluate a scalar integral for a massless two-loop three-point vertex\nwith all the external legs off-shell, and consider several special cases for\nit, yielding results, even for distinct simpler diagrams. We also consider the\npossibility of NDIM in non-covariant gauges such as the light-cone gauge and do\nsome illustrative calculations, showing that for one-degree violation of\ncovariance (i.e., one external, gauge-breaking, light-like vector $n_{\\mu}$)\nthe ensuing results are concordant with the ones obtained via either the usual\ndimensional regularization technique, or the use of principal value\nprescription for the gauge dependent pole, while for two-degree violation of\ncovariance --- i.e., two external, light-like vectors $n_{\\mu}$, the\ngauge-breaking one, and (its dual) $n^{\\ast}_{\\mu}$ --- the ensuing results are\nconcordant with the ones obtained via causal constraints or the use of the\nso-called generalized Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 1998 12:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

While we can measure\nif the particle arrives, we argue that the time at which it arrives always has\nan inherent ambiguity. The minimum inaccuracy of time-of-arrival measurements\nis given by dt>1/E where E is the kinetic energy of the particle. The use of\ntime-of-arrival operators, as well as current operators, is examined\ncritically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 1998 02:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 1998 23:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Thus, the case of complex values of lambda, which is useful in\nscattering theory, involves, in general, both a complex value of the parameter\noriginally viewed as the spatial dimension and complex values of the angular\nmomentum quantum number.
