Prior to the flash, the temperature of the gas\nwas 4000 - 5000 K, and helium was neutral, while the post-flash temperature was\nonly slightly less than 10^5 K, with the gas being ionized to helium-like\nionization stages of C, N and O. We have followed the slow post-flash cooling\nand recombination of the gas, as well as its line emission, and find that the\nstrongest lines are N V 1240 and O VI 1034. Both these lines are good probes\nfor the density of the gas, and suitable instruments to detect the lines are\nSTIS on HST and FUSE, respectively. Other lines which may be detectable are N\nIV] 1486 and [O III] 5007, though they are expected to be substantially weaker.\nThe relative strength of the oxygen lines is found to be a good tracer of the\ncolor temperature of the supernova flash. From previous observations, we put\nlimits on the hydrogen density, n_H, of the H II region. The early N V 1240\nflux measured by IUE gives an upper limit which is n_H ~ 180 \\eta^{-0.40}\ncm^{-3}, where \\eta is the filling factor of the gas. The recently reported\nemission in [O III] 5007 at 2500 days requires n_H = (160\\pm12) \\eta^{-0.19}\ncm^{-3}, for a supernova burst similar to that in the 500full1 model of Ensman\n& Burrows (1992). For the more energetic 500full2 burst the density is n_H =\n(215\\pm15) \\eta^{-0.19} cm^{-3}. These values are much higher than in models of\nthe X-ray emission from the supernova (n_H ~ 75 cm^{-3}), and it seems\nplausible that the observed [O III] emission is produced primarily elsewhere\nthan in the H II region. We also discuss the type of progenitor consistent with\nthe H II region. In particular, it seems unlikely that its spectral type was\nmuch earlier than B2 Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 1998 18:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
