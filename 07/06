For A401, A754, A1367, and\nA1656, data from the HEAO1-A2 High Energy Detector (HED) (2-60 keV) was\nincluded in a joint fit to further constrain the allowed non-thermal component.\nUpperlimits to the non-thermal X-ray emission are a factor of approximately 10\nimprovement over previous values. Lower limits to the average magnetic field\nderived from these upperlimits and the radio spectral parameters range from\n0.08 - 0.30 microGauss. A seed intracluster field amplified by turbulence from\ngalaxy motion through the intracluster medium should have an average value in\nthe range of 0.1-0.2 (Goldman & Rephaeli, 1991; De Young, 1992), thus the lack\nof any detections makes it unlikely that field amplification is due to galaxy\nwakes. In addition, all of these clusters have an asymmetric surface brightness\ndistribution while several also have X-ray spectroscopic evidence of a merger.\nWe suggest that cluster mergers rather than galaxy wakes are the source of the\nmagnetic field amplification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 1998 18:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Robust arguments for the existence of a\nrelativistic shock have been presented on the basis of radio observations. A\nphysical model based on the radio observations lead us to propose the following\ncharacteristics of supernovae GRBs (S-GRBs): 1) prompt radio emission and\nimplied brightness temperature near or below the inverse Compton limit, 2) high\nexpansion velocity of the optical photosphere as derived from lines widths and\nenergy release larger than usual, 3) no long-lived X-ray afterglow, and 4) a\nsingle pulse (SP) GRB profile. Radio studies of previous SNe show that only\ntype Ib and Ic potentially satisfy the first condition. Accordingly we have\ninvestigated proposed associations of GRBs and SNe finding no convincing\nevidence (mainly to paucity of data) to confirm any single connection of a SN\nwith a GRB. If there is a more constraining physical basis for the burst\ntime-history of S-GRBs beyond that of the SP requirement, we suggest the 1% of\nlight curves in the BATSE catalogue similar to that of GRB 980425 may\nconstitute the subclass. Future optical follow-up of bursts with similar\nprofiles should confirm if such GRBs originate from some fraction of SN type\nIb/Ic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 1998 23:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Both\ncomponents are evaluated for the electron gas in dimensionality D=3 and D=2 by\nan approximate decoupling in the equation of motion for the current density,\nwhich accounts for processes of excitation of two electron-hole pairs. Each\npair is treated in the random phase approximation, but the role of exchange and\ncorrelation is also examined; in addition, final-state exchange processes are\nincluded phenomenologically so as to satisfy the exactly known high-frequency\nbehaviours of the kernel. The transverse and longitudinal spectra involve the\nsame decay channels and are similar in shape. A two-plasmon threshold in the\nspectrum for two-pair excitations in D=3 leads to a sharp minimum in the real\npart of the exchange and correlation kernel at twice the plasma frequency. In\nD=2 the same mechanism leads to a broad spectral peak and to a broad minimum in\nthe real part of the kernel, as a consequence of the dispersion law of the\nplasmon vanishing at long wavelength. The numerical results have been fitted to\nsimple analytic functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 1998 11:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
