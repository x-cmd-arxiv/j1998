The elementary cross sections for those are obtained\nfrom chiral Lagrangians involving pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector\nmesons. The respective electromagnetic form factors are determined by fitting\nto experimental data for the reverse processes of $e^+e^-\\to hadrons$. Based on\nthis input we calculate cross sections and thermal dilepton emission rates and\ncompare our results with those from other approaches. Finally we use these\nelementary cross sections with a relativistic transport model and calculate\ndilepton spectra in S+W collisions at SPS energies. The comparison of our\nresults with experimental data from the HELIOS-3 collaboration indicates the\nimportance of the secondary hadronic contributions to the intermediate-mass\ndilepton spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 1998 15:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The model is based on the fundamental\nrelation between the probability for cavity formation in bulk water resulting\nfrom molecular-scale density fluctuations, and the hydration free energy of the\nsimplest hydrophobic solute, a hard particle. This probability is estimated\nusing an information theory (IT) approach, incorporating experimentally\navailable properties of bulk water -- the density and radial distribution\nfunction. The IT approach reproduces the simplest hydrophobic effects:\nhydration of spherical nonpolar solutes, the potential of mean force between\nmethane molecules, and solvent contributions to the torsional equilibrium of\nbutane. Applications of this approach to study temperature and pressure effects\nprovide new insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding.\nThe IT model relates the hydrophobic-entropy convergence observed in protein\nunfolding experiments to the macroscopic isothermal compressibility of water. A\nnovel explanation for pressure denaturation of proteins follows from an\nanalysis of the pressure stability of hydrophobic aggregates, suggesting that\nwater penetrates the hydrophobic core of proteins at high pressures. This\nresolves a long-standing puzzle, whether pressure denaturation contradicts the\nhydrophobic-core model of protein stability. Finally, issues of ``dewetting''\nof molecularly large nonpolar solutes are discussed in the context of a\nrecently developed perturbation theory approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 1998 20:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 1998 22:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}
