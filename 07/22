The key new feature of our model is that CMEs occur in multi-polar\ntopologies, in which reconnection between a sheared arcade and neighboring flux\nsystems triggers the eruption. In this ``magnetic breakout'' model,\nreconnection removes the unsheared field above the low-lying, sheared core flux\nnear the neutral line, thereby allowing this core flux to burst open.

At relatively high voltage (U > 0.1 V) the\nconduction of sample investigated corresponds well to Mott's variable-range\nhopping (VRH). An unusual conduction behavior is found, however, in low voltage\nrange (approximately below 0.1 V), where the influence of electric field and\n(or) electron heating effect on VRH ought to be neglected. Here we have\nobserved strong increase in resistance at increasing U at T < 20 K, whereas at\nT > 20 K the resistance decreases with increasing U. The magnetoresistance of\nthe sample below 20 K has been positive at low voltage and negative at high\nvoltage. The observed non-Ohmic behavior is attributable to inhomogeneity of\nthe sample, and namely, to the enrichment of sample surface with oxygen during\nthe course of the heat treatment of the sample in helium and air atmosphere\nbefore measurements. At low enough temperature (below 20 K) the surface layer\nwith increased oxygen concentration is presumed to consist of disconnected\nsuperconducting regions (with T_{c} about 20 K) in poor-conducting matrix. The\nresults obtained demonstrate that transport properties of cuprate oxides may be\ndetermined in essential degree by structural or stoichimetric inhomogeneities.\nThis should be taken into account at evaluation of \"quality\" of\nhigh-temperature superconductors on the basis of transport properties\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 1998 14:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The method is based upon a linearization principle\nwhich can be applied on nonlinearities which have a polynomial form. We\nillustrate the potential of the method by finding solutions of the (coupled)\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation and the Manakov equation which play an\nimportant role in optical fiber communication. Finally, it is shown that the\nmethod can also be generalized to higher-dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 1998 08:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
