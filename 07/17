For the\ntime-averaged accretion rates typical of low-mass X-ray transients, standard\nneutrino cooling is unimportant and the core thermally re-radiates the\ndeposited heat. The resulting luminosity has the same magnitude as that\nobserved from several transient neutron stars in quiescence. Confirmation of\nthis mechanism would strongly constrain rapid neutrino cooling mechanisms for\nneutron stars. Thermal emission had previously been dismissed as a predominant\nsource of quiescent emission since blackbody spectral fits implied an emitting\narea much smaller than a neutron star's surface. However, as with thermal\nemission from radio pulsars, fits with realistic emergent spectra will imply a\nsubstantially larger emitting area. Other emission mechanisms, such as\naccretion or a pulsar shock, can also operate in quiescence and generate\nintensity and spectral variations over short timescales.

For the case of spin-flip scattering of\nthe conduction electrons due to the absorption and emission of magnons, the\nBoltzmann equation is exactly soluble to the linear order. From this solution\nwe calculate the temperature dependence of the resistivity due to single magnon\nprocesses at sufficiently low temperature, namely $k_BT\\ll D/L^2$, where $L$ is\nthe Anderson localization length and $D$ is the magnon stiffness. And depending\non the details of the minority spin density of states at the Fermi level, we\nfind a $T^{1.5}$ or $T^{2}$ scaling behavior for resistivity. Relevance to the\ndoped perovskite manganite systems is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 1998 18:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

For the\nspecial case of spherically reduced Einstein gravity it coincides with the mass\nin the Schwarzschild solution. The corresponding Noether symmetry has been\nderived previously by P.

The related\nNoether-like symmetry differs from the usual one. The parameters for the\nsymmetry transformation of the geometric part and those of the matterfields are\ndistinct. The total conservation law (a zero-form current) results from a two\nstage argument which also involves a consistency condition expressed by the\nconservation of a one-form matter ``current''.

Two common responses to these violations are: (i) the rejection\nof realism and the retention of locality, and (ii) the rejection of locality\nand the retention of realism. Here we critique response (i). We argue that\nlocality contains an implicit form of realism, since in a world view that\nembraces locality, spacetime, with its usual, fixed topology, has properties\nindependent of measurement. Hence we argue that response (i) is incomplete, in\nthat its rejection of realism is only partial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 1998 18:28:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 1998 21:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 1998 19:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 1998 20:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The method we\nuse is quite different from that used in Balazs and Voros (ref.\n\\QCITE{cite}{}{BV}) and Saraceno (ref. \\QCITE{cite}{}{S}). We first construct a\nnatural ``baker covering map'' on the plane $\\QTO{mathbb}{\\mathbb{R}}^{2}$. We\nthen use as the quantum algebra of observables the subalgebra of operators on\n$L^{2}(\\QTO{mathbb}{\\mathbb{R}}) $ generated by $\\left\\{\\exp (2\\pi i\\hat{x})\n,\\exp (2\\pi i\\hat{p}) \\right\\} $ . We construct a unitary propagator such that\nas $\\hbar \\to 0$ the classical dynamics is returned. For Planck's constant\n$h=1/N$, we show that the dynamics can be reduced to the dynamics on an\n$N$-dimensional Hilbert space, and the unitary $N\\times N$ matrix propagator is\nthe same as given in ref. \\QCITE{cite}{}{BV} except for a small correction of\norder $h$. This correction is shown to preserve the classical symmetry $x\\to\n1-x$ and $p\\to 1-p$ in the quantum dynamics for periodic boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 1998 15:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
