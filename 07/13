This new algorithm can also be used as an algorithm for the random\ngeneration of tableaux of a given shape with bounded entries. An appropriate\ndeformation of this algorithm gives an algorithm for the random generation of\nplane partitions inside a given box.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 1998 15:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
