The authors' previous result that the complex is\ndelta-hyperbolic was hard to apply because the complex is not locally finite;\nin this paper some tools are developed for overcoming this problem, and a\ncombinatorial mechanism introduced which describes sequences of elementary\nmoves in the graph of markings on a surface. These tools are applied to give a\nfamily of quasi-geodesic words in the Mapping Class Group, and a linear bound\non the shortest word conjugating two conjugate pseudo-Anosov elements.\n  A basic tool in the analysis is a family of subsurface projections, which are\nroughly analogous to closest-point projections to horoballs in classical\nhyperbolic space. These projections have a strong contraction property which\nmakes it possible to tie together the geometry of the complex and that of the\n(infinite) subcomplexes that arise as links of vertices. The resulting layered\nstructure of the complex is controlled by means of a combinatorial device\ncalled a hierarchy of geodesics, which is the central construction of the\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 1998 15:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
