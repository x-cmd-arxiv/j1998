The goal of\nthis work is to study the detectability of very high redshift galaxies and to\ntry to characterize Wide Deep-Field observations. The main points made in this\npaper are 1) high-z galaxies observable by NGST would be similar to local\nstarburst galaxies 2) even if they exist, large spiral galaxies similar to\nlocal ones would not be observed by a NGST-like telescope and 3) the density of\nhigh-z galaxies detected so far is apparently moderate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 1998 08:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 1998 10:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This prevents the\nonset of the cooling wave which would otherwise return the disc to the\nquiescent state, and so prolongs the outbursts beyond those in dwarf nova\ndiscs. KR show that the decay of the resulting X-ray light curve should be\nexponential or linear depending on whether or not the observed peak X-ray\nluminosity is sufficient to ionize the outer edge of the accretion disc. Here\nwe examine the observed X-ray decays, and show that they are exponential or\nlinear according as the peak luminosity is greater or smaller than the critical\nvalue defined by KR, strongly suggesting that the light curves are indeed\nirradiation--dominated. We show further that the occurrence of an exponential\nor linear decay tends to favour the same type of decay in subsequent outbursts,\nso that systems usually show only one or the other type. We use the equations\nof KR and the observed X-ray light curve to determine the size $R_{h}$ of the\nhot disc at the peak of the outburst. For exponential decays, $R_{h}$ is found\nto be comparable to the circularization radius, as expected since the disc\nconsists entirely of material transferred from the secondary since the previous\noutburst. Further, $R_h$ is directly proportional to the time at which one sees\nthe secondary maximum ($t_{s}$), as expected if $t_{s}$ is the viscous\ntimescale of the irradiated disc. This implies that the orders of magnitude of\nthe viscosity parameter alpha and disc aspect ratio H/R are such that alpha\n(H/R)~0.01. Observation of a secondary maximum calibrates the peak luminosity\nand gives an eqaution for the distance to the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 1998 15:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

In the pure harmonic oscillator potential it is shown that\nwhen one particle (or hole) with the mass single-particle quadrupole moment\nq_{nu} is added to a superdeformed core, the change of the electric quadrupole\nmoment can be parameterized as q_{eff}=e(bq_{nu}+a), and analytical expressions\nare derived for the two parameters, $a$ and $b$. Simple numerical expressions\nfor q_{eff}(q_\\nu}) are obtained in the more realistic modified oscillator\nmodel. It is also shown that quadrupole moments of nuclei with up to 10\nparticles removed from the superdeformed core of 152Dy can be well described by\nsimply subtracting effective quadrupole moments of the active single-particle\nstates from the quadrupole moment of the core. Tools are given for estimating\nthe quadrupole moment for possible configurations in the superdeformed A\n150-region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 1998 09:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We analyze the resonance conditions and\nestimate the growth rates of the Cherenkov and cyclotron instabilities of the\nordinary (O), extraordinary (X) and Alfv\\'{e}n modes in two limiting regimes:\nkinetic and hydrodynamic. As a preliminary step, we reconsider wave dispersion\nand polarization properties in a one dimensional pair plasma taking into\naccount relativistic thermal effects.

The importance of the different instabilities\nas a source of the coherent pulsar radiation generation is then estimated\ntaking into account the angular dependence of the growth rates and the\nlimitations on the length of the coherent wave-particle interaction imposed by\nthe curvature of the magnetic field lines. We conclude, that in the pulsar\nmagnetosphere the Cherenkov-type instabilities occur in the hydrodynamic\nregimes, while the cyclotron-type instabilities occur in the kinetic regime.

In this\nZPF-inertia theory, mass is postulated to be not an intrinsic property of\nmatter but rather a kind of electromagnetic drag force that proves to be\nacceleration dependent by virtue of the spectral characteristics of the ZPF.\nThe theory proposes that interactions between the ZPF and matter take place at\nthe level of quarks and electrons, hence would account for the mass of a\ncomposite neutral particle such as the neutron. An effort to generalize the\nexploratory study of Haisch, Rueda and Puthoff (1994) into a proper\nrelativistic formulation has been successful. Moreover the principle of\nequivalence implies that in this view gravitation would also be electromagnetic\nin origin along the lines proposed by Sakharov (1968). With regard to exotic\npropulsion we can definitively rule out one speculatively hypothesized\nmechanism: matter possessing negative inertial mass, a concept originated by\nBondi (1957) is shown to be logically impossible. On the other hand, the linked\nZPF-inertia and ZPF-gravity concepts open the conceptual possibility of\nmanipulation of inertia and gravitation, since both are postulated to be\nelectromagnetic phenomena. It is hoped that this will someday translate into\nactual technological potential. A key question is whether the proposed\nZPF-matter interactions generating the phenomenon of mass might involve one or\nmore resonances. This is presently under investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 1998 00:41:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 1998 19:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The Larmor\nrotation of a test particle in a magnetic field is taken into account. The\nanalysis is based on the assumption that the energy variation of the test\nparticle is much less than its kinetic energy. The obtained general expression\nfor stopping power is analyzed for three cases: (i) the particle moves through\na collisionless plasma in a strong homogeneous magnetic field; (ii) the fast\nparticle moves through a magnetized collisionless plasma along the magnetic\nfield; and (iii) the particle moves through a magnetized collisional plasma\nacross a magnetic field. Calculations are carried out for the arbitrary test\nparticle velocities in the first case, and for fast particles in the second and\nthird cases.
