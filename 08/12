The nebula is in a state of energy\nequipartition between energy input from starlight and energy stored in gas\npressure, kinetic outflow, and the magnetic field. There is much that is not\nclear, however. How can gas flow away from the PDR into the face of a radiation\nfield that produces such effective radiative acceleration? Grains are\nphotoionized by the stellar radiation field, and this charge establishes a\nCoulomb drag that couples the grains to the gas.

From the brightest giants and blue stragglers at V ~ 11 to\nthe faintest lower main-sequence stars that were observed (at V ~ 21, M_V ~ 9),\nthe C-M diagram is well defined. A prominent clump of core helium-burning stars\nis evident at V = 13.0 and the upper end of the main sequence shows a fairly\npronounced curvature to the red, which is indicative of significant convective\ncore overshooting. Indeed, comparisons with up-to-date stellar models show that\nit is not possible to explain the observed morphology in the vicinity of the\nturnoff unless the overshooting is quite extensive. Interestingly, if\nsufficient overshooting is assumed in order to match the main-sequence data, it\nis not possible to reproduce the cluster's extended giant branch unless the\ncluster age is at least 1.6 Gyr (assuming a metallicity in the range -0.2 <=\n[Fe/H] <= 0.0). This, in turn, requires that the cluster have an apparent\ndistance modulus (m-M)_V <= 12.2. Thus, sometime within the past few hundred\nmillion years, the ignition of helium burning in NGC 7789 has switched from a\nquiescent to an explosive (``flash'') phenomenon, and the length of the\ncluster's red-giant branch has been steadily increasing with the passage of\ntime since then.

The combined microlensing optical depth of the MACHO and\nEROS-1 surveys is tau_LMC = 2.1{+1.3/-0.8}* 10^{-7} which is substantially\nlarger than the background of tau < 0.5* 10^{-7} from lensing by known stars\nbut is below the expected microlensing optical depth of tau = 4.7*10^{-7} for a\nhalo composed entirely of Machos. The simplest interpretation of this result is\nthat nearly half of the dark halo is composed of Machos with a typical mass of\norder 0.5 Msun. These Machos could be old white dwarfs, but it is not obvious\nthat the generation of stars that preceded these white dwarfs could have gone\nundetected. Perhaps, the Machos could be non-baryonic, but there is no\ncompelling model for the formation of non-baryonic Machos. Therefore, some\nauthors have tried to develop alternative models which attempt to explain the\nLMC microlensing results with non-halo lenses. Many of these models postulate\npreviously unknown dark stellar populations which contribute significantly to\nthe total mass of the Galaxy and are therefore simply variations of the dark\nmatter solution. However, models which postulate an unknown dwarf galaxy along\nthe line of sight to the LMC or a distortion of the LMC which significantly\nenhances the LMC self-lensing optical depth can potentially explain the LMC\nlensing results with only a small amount of mass, so these can be regarded as\ntrue non-dark matter solutions to the Macho puzzle. All such models that have\nbeen proposed so far have serious problems, so there is as yet no compelling\nalternative to the dark matter interpretation. However, the problem can be\nsolved observationally with a second generation gravitational microlensing\nsurvey that is significantly more sensitive than current microlensing surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 1998 15:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Such a construction, called the minimally bosonized SUSYQM, appeared\nin the context of integrable systems and dynamical symmetries. We show that the\nminimally bosonized SUSYQM can be obtained from Witten's SUSYQM by applying to\nit a nonlocal unitary transformation with a subsequent reduction to one of the\neigenspaces of the total reflection operator. The transformation depends on the\nparity operator, and the deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection,\nintimately related to parabosons and parafermions, emerges here in a natural\nway. It is shown that the minimally bosonized SUSYQM can also be understood as\nsupersymmetric two-fermion system. With this interpretation, the bosonization\nconstruction is generalized to the case of N=1 supersymmetry in 2 dimensions.\nThe same special unitary transformation diagonalises the Hamiltonian operator\nof the 2D massive free Dirac theory. The resulting Hamiltonian is not a square\nroot like in the Foldy-Wouthuysen case, but is linear in spatial derivative.\nSubsequent reduction to `up' or `down' field component gives rise to a linear\ndifferential equation with reflection whose `square' is the massive\nKlein-Gordon equation. In the massless limit this becomes the self-dual Weyl\nequation. The linear differential equation with reflection admits\ngeneralizations to higher dimensions and can be consistently coupled to gauge\nfields. The bosonized SUSYQM can also be generated applying the nonlocal\nunitary transformation to the Dirac field in the background of a nonlinear\nscalar field in a kink configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 1998 21:51:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 1998 23:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Common examples violating\nthis condition are prolines and loops closed by S-S bridges in proteins. The\nmost important such case, however, is nucleic acids because the flexibility of\nthe furanose rings always plays an essential role in conformational transitions\nboth in DNA and RNA. There are a few long-known theoretical approaches to this\nproblem, but, in practice, rings with fixed bond lengths are closed by adding\nappropriate harmonic distance restraints, which is not always acceptable\nespecially in dynamics. This paper tries to overcome this handicap of ICMD and\nproposes a rational strategy which results in practical numerical algorithms.\nIt gives a unified analytical treatment which shows that this problem is very\nclose to the difficulties encountered by the method of constraints in Cartesian\ncoordinate dynamics, and certain ideas of the latter appear helpful in the\ncontext of ICMD. The method is affordable for large molecules and generally\napplicable to all kinds of rings. A specific implementation for five-membered\nrings is described and tested for a proline-rich polypeptide and a decamer DNA\nduplex. In both cases conditions are found which make possible time steps\naround 10 fsec in ICMD calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 1998 09:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
