This new strategy is designed to detect planets in\n\"wide\" orbits, i.e., with orbital separation, $a$ greater than $\\sim 1.5 R_E$.\nPlanets in wide orbits may provide the dominant channel for the microlensing\ndiscovery of planets, particularly low-mass (e.g., Earth-mass) planets. This\npaper concentrates on events in which a single planet serves as a lens, leading\nto an isolated event of short duration. We point out that a distribution of\nevents due to lensing by stars with wide-orbit planets is necessarily\naccompanied by a distribution of shorter- duration events. The fraction of\nevents in the latter distribution is proportional to the average value of\n$\\sqrt{q}$, where $q$ is the ratio between \\pl and stellar masses. The position\nof the peak or peaks also provides a measure of the mass ratios typical of\nplanetary systems. We study detection strategies that can optimize our ability\nto discover isolated short-duration events due to lensing by planets, and find\nthat monitoring employing sensitive photometry is particularly useful. If\nplanetary systems similar to our own are common, even modest changes in\ndetection strategy should lead to the discovery of a few isolated events of\nshort duration every year. We therefore also address the issue of the\ncontamination due to stellar populations of any microlensing signal due to\nlow-mass MACHOs. We describe how, even for isolated events of short duration,\nit will be possible to test the hypothesis that the lens was a planet instead\nof a low-mass MACHO, if the central star of the planetary system contributes a\nmeasurable fraction of the baseline flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 1998 01:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

On a finite set,\nthere is a counterpart of the continuum metric tensor with a simple geometric\ninterpretation. The latter is based on a correspondence between first order\ndifferential calculi and digraphs. Arrows originating from a vertex span its\n(co)tangent space. If the metric is to measure length and angles at some point,\nit has to be taken as an element of the left-linear tensor product of the space\nof 1-forms with itself, and not as an element of the (non-local) tensor product\nover the algebra of functions. It turns out that linear connections can always\nbe extended to this left tensor product, so that metric compatibility can be\ndefined in the same way as in continuum Riemannian geometry. In particular, in\nthe case of the universal differential calculus on a finite set, the Euclidean\ngeometry of polyhedra is recovered from conditions of metric compatibility and\nvanishing torsion. In our rather general framework (which also comprises\nstructures which are far away from continuum differential geometry), there is\nin general nothing like a Ricci tensor or a curvature scalar. Because of the\nnon-locality of tensor products (over the algebra of functions) of forms,\ncorresponding components (with respect to some module basis) turn out to be\nrather non-local objects. But one can make use of the parallel transport\nassociated with a connection to `localize' such objects and in certain cases\nthere is a distinguished way to achieve this. This leads to covariant\ncomponents of the curvature tensor which then allow a contraction to a Ricci\ntensor. In the case of a differential calculus associated with a hypercubic\nlattice we propose a new discrete analogue of the (vacuum) Einstein equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 1998 15:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We also construct a set of gauge-invariant operator-valued quark and gluon\nfields by establishing an explicit unitary equivalence between the Gauss's law\noperator and the `pure glue' part of the Gauss's law operator. This unitary\nequivalence enables us to use the `pure glue' Gauss's law operator to represent\nthe entire Gauss's law operator in a new representation. Since the quark field\ncommutes with the `pure glue' Gauss's law operator, it is a gauge-invariant\nfield in this new representation. We use the unitary equivalence of the new and\nthe conventional representations to construct gauge-invariant quark and gluon\nfields in both representations, and to transform the QCD Hamiltonian in the\ntemporal gauge so that it is expressed entirely in terms of gauge-invariant\nquantities. In that form, all interactions between quark fields mediated by\n`pure gauge' components of the gluon field have been transformed away, and\nreplaced by a nonlocal interaction between gauge-invariant color-charge\ndensities. This feature --- that, in gauge-invariant formulations, interactions\nmediated by pure gauge components of gauge fields have been replaced by\nnonlocal interactions --- is shared by many gauge theories. In QED, the\nresulting nonlocal interaction is the Coulomb interaction, which is the Abelian\nanalog of the QCD interaction we have identified and are describing in this\nwork. The leading term, in a multipole expansion, of this nonlocal QCD\ninteraction vanishes for quarks in color-singlet configurations, suggesting a\ndynamical origin for color confinement; higher order terms of this multipole\nexpansion suggest a QCD mechanism for color transparency. We also show how, in\nan SU(2) model, this nonlocal interaction can be evaluated nonperturbatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 1998 21:18:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 1999 15:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
