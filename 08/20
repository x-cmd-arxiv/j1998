We calculate the equation of state and the composition of\nmatter before and after deconfinement by using a relativistic mean-field theory\nand an MIT bag model, respectively; the case in which hyperons are present in\nthe hadronic system is considered, together with the case of the system without\nhyperons. We find that strangeness contained in hyperons acts to reduce a\ndensity jump at deconfinement as well as a lepton fraction in the hadronic\nphase. As a result of these reductions, a quark matter droplet being in a\nvirtual or real state has its effective mass lightened and its electric charge\ndiminished into nearly zero. The Coulomb screening of leptons on the droplet\ncharge, which has significance to the droplet growth after nucleation in the\nabsence of hyperons, is thus shown to be of little consequence. If the\neffective droplet mass is small enough to become comparable to the height of\nthe potential barrier, the effect of relativity brings about an exponential\nincrease in the rate of droplet formation via quantum tunneling, whereas the\nrole played by energy dissipation in decelerating the droplet formation,\ndominant for matter without hyperons, becomes of less importance. For matter\nwith and without hyperons, we estimate the overpressure needed to form the\nfirst droplet in the star during the compression due to stellar spin-down or\nmass accretion from a companion star. The temperature at which a crossover from\nthe quantum nucleation to the Arrhenius-type thermal nucleation takes place is\nshown to be large compared with the temperature of matter in the core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 1998 10:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
