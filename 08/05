Apart from identifying well-detected sources, such data can also\nbe mined for information about fainter sources and their correlations, as\nrevealed through low level fluctuations in SCUBA maps. As a first step in this\ndirection we analyse a small SCUBA data-set as if it were obtained from a\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) differencing experiment. This enables us to\nplace limits on CMB anisotropy at 850 microns. Expressed as Q_{flat}, the\nquadrupole expectation value for a flat power spectrum, the limit is 152\nmicroKelvin at 95 per cent confidence, corresponding to C_0^{1/2} < 355\nmicroKelvin for a Gaussian autocorrelation function, with a coherence angle of\nabout 20--25 arcsec; These results could easily be reinterpretted in terms of\nany other fluctuating sky signal. This is currently the best limit for these\nscales at high frequency, and comparable to limits at similar angular scales in\nthe radio. Even with such a modest data-set, it is possible to put a constraint\non the slope of the SCUBA counts at the faint end, since even randomly\ndistributed sources would lead to fluctuations. Future analysis of sky\ncorrelations in more extensive data-sets ought to yield detections, and hence\nadditional information on source counts and clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 1998 17:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

These\nconstrained models are not expected to differ dramatically in their local\nlarge-scale structure properties. However, their evolutionary histories differ,\nresulting in dramatic differences towards high redshift. We examine in detail\nsix standardized, COBE and cluster normalized CDM models with respect to a\nlarge set of independent observations. The observations include correlation\nfunction of rich clusters of galaxies, galaxy power spectrum, evolution of rich\ncluster abundance, gravitational lensing by moderate -to-high redshift\nclusters, $\\lya$ forest, damped $\\lya$ systems, high redshift galaxies,\nreionization of the universe and future CMB experiments.

To many, this seems undesirable in a theory of physical\ninferences.

With the help of a new sum rule which we have derived\nrecently we show that the quadratic and logarithmic divergences generated in\nthe bare theory are related to corresponding mass shifts in old-fashioned\nlight-front perturbation theory. We present numerical results for the $F_2$ and\n$F_L$ structure functions for the meson in two-dimensional QCD in the one pair\napproximation. We discuss the relevance of our results for the problem of the\npartitioning of hadron mass in QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 1998 09:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

The theories are based on the general idea of probabilistic\ndetection of particles depending on an interaction of hidden variables within\nthe measuring device and particle, and relate mathematically to Fourier\nanalysis. The crucial discrepancy of variations in the hidden variable\ndistribution based on relative polarizer orientations is isolated which\ninvalidates assumptions in Bell-type theorems. The first theory can be analyzed\ncompletely symbolically whereas the second was analyzed using numerical\nmethods. The properties of the second in particular are shown to be\napproximately consistent with the reported results and uncertainties in all\nthree Aspect experiments. Variation in the total photon pairs detected over\norientations is shown to be a basic characteristic of these theories. Some\ncomments on the relevance of active vs. passive locality are made. Two sections\nconsider these ideas relative to energy conservation and the measurement\nproblem (collapse of the wavefunction). One section proposes new experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 1998 01:03:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 1998 22:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

They showed that the quantum\ninformation is nothing else than the maximal Fisher information in a\nmeasurement of the quantum system, maximized over all possible measurements.\nCombining this fact with classical statistical results, they argued that the\nquantum information determines the asymptotically optimal rate at which\nneighbouring states on some smooth curve can be distinguished, based on\narbitrary measurements on $n$ identical copies of the given quantum system.\n  We show that the measurement which maximizes the Fisher information typically\ndepends on the true, unknown, state of the quantum system. We close the\nresulting loophole in the argument by showing that one can still achieve the\nsame, optimal, rate of distinguishability, by a two stage adaptive measurement\nprocedure.\n  When we consider states lying not on a smooth curve, but on a manifold of\nhigher dimension, the situation becomes much more complex. We show that the\nnotion of ``distinguishability of close-by states'' depends strongly on the\nmeasurement resources one allows oneself, and on a further specification of the\ntask at hand.
