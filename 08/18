The phase diagram has a chiral symmetry\nbreaking vacuum, a color superconductor phase at high density, and a mixed\nphase in between which can describe nuclear matter if the high density regions\nin the mixed phase form droplets. This is amusingly similar to the phase\ndiagram of the copper oxide superconductors, although their critical\ntemperatures are smaller by a factor of about 10^{-9} and their mixed phase\nseems to form stripes, rather than droplets.
