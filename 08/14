For the model case of particles in a j-shell, it is shown that\nexcitation spectra and the alignment processes are well described as compared\nto the exact shell model calculation. Realistic cranked shell model\ncalculations are able to describe the experimental spectra of $^{72,73}$Kr and\n$^{74}$Rb isotopes. \\\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 1998 07:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
