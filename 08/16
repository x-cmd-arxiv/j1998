Eisenbud and J. Harris developed the general theory of limit\nlinear series, Invent. math. 85 (1986), in order to understand what happens to\nlinear systems and their ramification points on families of non-singular curves\ndegenerating to curves of compact type. They applied their theory to the study\nof limits of Weierstrass points, among other endeavours. In one of their\narticles, Invent. math. 87 (1987), they asked: \"What are the limits of\nWeierstrass points in families of curves degenerating to stable curves not of\ncompact type?\" In this eprint we address this question within a more general\nframework. More precisely, given a family of linear systems on a family of\nnon-singular curves degenerating to a nodal curve we give a formula for the\nlimit of the associated ramification divisors in terms of certain limits of the\nfamily of linear systems. In contrast with the theory of limit linear series of\nEisenbud's and Harris', we do not need to blow up the family to swerve the\ndegenerating ramification points away from the nodes of the limit curve.\nIndeed, we can assign the adequate weight to the limit ramification divisor at\nany point of the limit curve. In a forthcoming submission we shall deal with\nthe specific question of limits of Weierstrass points, assuming certain generic\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 1998 04:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmultiplicity of the pions (having pT > 0.5 GeV/c) in the central rapidity\nregion, is seen to scale as \\sim (N_part)^alpha, where N_part$ is the number of\nparticipating nucleons, which we have approximated as 2A for central collisions\nof identical nuclei. We argue that the deviation of \\alpha (\\simeq 1.2) from\nunity may have its origin in the multiple scattering suffered by the partons.\nWe also find that the constant of proportionality in the above scaling relation\nincreases substantially in going from SPS to RHIC energies. This would imply\nthat the (semi)hard partonic activity becomes a much cleaner signal above the\nsoft particle production at the higher energy of RHIC, and thus much less\ndependent on the (lack of) understanding of the underlying soft physics\nbackground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 1998 16:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

An array of ionization probes with\nrelatively high spatial and temporal resolutions was developed for diagnosing\nthe absolute injected-gas density and its spatial profile. The properties of\nthe gas column were also studied using spectroscopy of line emission that\nresults from the interaction of the doped gas with the POS prefilled plasma.\nThe doped column is found to have a width of ~1 cm and a density of\n(0.8-1.7)*10^14 cm-3. Observations of characteristic emission lines from the\ndoped atoms and their ions allow for various spectroscopic measurements, such\nas the magnetic field from Zeeman splitting and the ion velocity distributions\nfrom Doppler shifts, that are local in three dimensions. It is shown that this\ngas doping technique can also be used to study proton-dominated plasmas that\ncannot be studied with simple emission spectroscopy due to the lack of light\nemitting ions. The variety of gases used with this method, together with the\nsmall valve dimensions and its fast opening, make it potentially useful for\nbroad diagnostics of various short-duration plasma experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 1998 13:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
