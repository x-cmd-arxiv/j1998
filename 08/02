We focus\non identifying possible systematic errors and rank the methods by relative\nimmunity to such errors. For the three most robust methods, statistical\nparallax, trigonometric parallax, and cluster kinematics, we find M_V (at\n[Fe/H] = -1.6) of 0.77 +/- 0.13, 0.71 +/- 0.15, 0.67 +/- 0.10. These methods\ncluster consistently around 0.71 +/- 0.07. We find that Baade-Wesselink and\ntheoretical models both yield a broad range of possible values (0.45-0.70 and\n0.45-0.65) due to systematic uncertainties in the temperature scale and input\nphysics. Main-sequence fitting gives a much brighter M_V = 0.45 +/- 0.04 but\nthis may be due to a difference in the metallicity scales of the cluster giants\nand the calibrating subdwarfs. White-dwarf cooling-sequence fitting gives 0.67\n+/- 0.13 and is potentially very robust, but at present is too new to be fully\ntested for systematics. If the three most robust methods are combined with\nWalker's mean measurement for 6 LMC clusters, V_{0,LMC} = 18.98 +/- 0.03 at\n[Fe/H] = -1.9, then mu_{LMC} = 18.33 +/- 0.08.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 1998 13:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The photometric profiles in the BVRJHK bands can\nbe fitted with a combination of gaussian and exponential profiles,\ncorresponding to a starburst nucleus and a stellar disk respectively. The\nexponential scale length in the B-band is 2.8 times larger than in the K-band,\nwhich implies a central B-band optical depth as high as 11. A bulge is absent\neven in the NIR bands and hence the galaxy must be of a morphological type\nlater than the usually adopted Sb type. Relatively low rotational velocity and\nhigh gas content also favor a later type, probably Sd, for the galaxy. Only one\narm can be traced in the distribution of old stars; the second arm, however,\ncan be traced in the distribution of dust and HII regions. Data suggest a short\nNIR bar, which ends inside the nuclear ring. The slowly rising nature of the\nrotation curve rules out a resonance origin of the the nuclear ring. The ring\nis most likely not in the plane of the galaxy, given its circular appearance in\nspite of the moderately high inclination of the galaxy. The off-planar nature\nof the star forming ring, the unusually high fraction (30%) of the total mass\nin molecular form, the presence of a nuclear starburst and the asymmetry of\nspiral arms, are probably the result of a merger with a gas-rich companion\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 1998 15:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
