Luminosities are computed\nfor each model galaxy using their full star formation histories and the latest\nspectrophotometric models. We find that at z=0 the stellar mass of model\ngalaxies is proportional to the total baryonic mass within the virial radius of\ntheir surrounding halos. Circular velocity then correlates tightly with the\ntotal luminosity of the galaxy, reflecting the equivalence between mass and\ncircular velocity of systems identified in a cosmological context. The slope of\nthe relation steepens slightly from the red to the blue bandpasses, and is in\nfairly good agreement with observations. Its scatter is small, decreasing from\n\\~0.45 mag in the U-band to ~0.34 mag in the K-band. The particular\ncosmological model we explore here seems unable to account for the zero-point\nof the correlation. Model galaxies are too faint at z=0 (by about two\nmagnitudes) if the circular velocity at the edge of the luminous galaxy is used\nas an estimator of the rotation speed. The Tully-Fisher relation is brighter in\nthe past, by about ~0.7 magnitudes in the B-band at z=1, at odds with recent\nobservations of z~1 galaxies. We conclude that the slope and tightness of the\nTully-Fisher relation can be naturally explained in hierarchical models but\nthat its normalization and evolution depend strongly on the star formation\nalgorithm chosen and on the cosmological parameters that determine the\nuniversal baryon fraction and the time of assembly of galaxies of different\nmass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 1998 18:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-29"}
