In the\nabelian gauge, unit-charge magnetic monopoles appear, but multi-charge\nmonopoles do not in general cases. The appearance of the monopole is studied\nusing the gauge-connection formalism in relation to the SU($N_c$) singular\ngauge transformation. The relevant role of off-diagonal gluons is found for the\nappearance of monopoles in the abelian gauge in QCD. We study the gluon-field\nproperties around the monopole in the MA gauge in terms of the action density\nusing the lattice QCD. The monopole provides infinitely large field\nfluctuations in the abelian sector. In the MA gauge, off-diagonal gluons are\nstrongly suppressed but largely remain around the monopole, which indicates the\neffective size and the structure of monopoles. We find the large cancellation\nbetween the abelian part and the off-diagonal part of the action density around\nthe monopole in the MA gauge. Owing to this cancellation, the monopole can\nappear in QCD without large cost of the QCD action. Finally, we generalize the\nframework of the abelian projection, {\\it i.e.} the extraction of the abelian\ngauge manifold from QCD, by introducing the `gluonic Higgs field' $\\vec\n\\phi_D[A_\\mu(x)]$ defined from the ${\\rm SU}(N_c)$ covariant derivative $\\hat\nD_\\mu$.
