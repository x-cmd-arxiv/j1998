In the model, changes of two parameters regulate\nthe paths in the 2-color diagram: the black body temperature (Tin) of the inner\ndisk and the Thomson optical depth multiplied by the electron temperature of\nthe hot phase (tau*Te).

In\nthis paper, we derive structure equations of the fallback atmosphere and\npresent results of one-dimensional simulations of that fallback. The atmosphere\nremaining after neutrino cooling becomes unimportant (less than the Compton\nEddington limit) is only a fraction of the total mass accreted (10^-8 of the\naccreted mass or 10^-9 solar masses.)

The flavor\nchanging rates are controlled by tree level amplitudes and quadratic products\nof different R parity violating coupling constants and the CP asymmetries by\ninterference terms between tree and loop level amplitudes and quartic products.\nThe consideration of loop amplitudes is restricted to the photon and Z-boson\nvertex corrections. We present numerical results using a family and species\nindependent mass parameter, $\\tilde m$, for all the scalar superpartners and\nmaking simple assumptions for the family dependence of the R parity odd\ncoupling constants. The flavor non-diagonal rates, $\\s_{JJ'}$, vary in the\nrange, $(\\l/0.1)^4 2 - 20$ fbarns, as one spans the interval of center of mass\nenergies from the Z-boson pole up to 1000 GeV. For sleptons masses, $\\tilde m>\n150 $ GeV, these observables could be of use at NLC energies to set useful\nbounds on the R parity odd coupling constants. The values of the asymmetries,\nvary from a few to a few tens of $10^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 1998 17:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The remarkable results of Kapranov exhibiting the latter\nspace as a Chow quotient, Hilbert quotient, and so on, all have counterparts\nfor complete collineations.\n  This analogy encompasses Vainsencher's construction of the complete\ncollineations, as well as a form of the Gel'fand-MacPherson correspondence.\nThere is also a tangential relation with the Gromov-Witten invariants of\nGrassmannians. The symmetric and anti-symmetric versions of the problem are\nconsidered as well.\n  An appendix explains the original motivation, which came from the space of\nbroken Morse flows for the moment map of a circle action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 1998 15:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2001 22:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

All thermodynamic functions, including the definition of the\ntemperature, are shown to be meaningful. The thermodynamic potential from which\nall relevant physical information in equilibrium can be extracted, is defined\nconsistently. The most important findings are the following two: (1) The\ntemperature is defined exactly in the same way as in classical statistical\nmechanics as the derivative of the energy with respect to the entropy at\nconstant volume. (2) Observables are defined in the same way as in Boltzmannian\nstatistics as the linear averages of the new equilibrium distribution function.\nThis lets us conclude that the new state is a real thermodynamic equilibrium in\nsystems capable of strong turbulence with the new distribution function\nreplacing the Boltzmann distribution in such systems. We discuss the ideal gas,\nfind the equation of state, and derive the specific heat and adiabatic exponent\nfor such a gas. We also derive the new Gibbsian distribution of states. Finally\nwe discuss the physical reasons for the development of such states and the\nobservable properties of the new distribution function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 1998 16:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
