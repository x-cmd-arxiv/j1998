In this paper we\ncalculate (by using Monte -Carlo simulations) the specific features of X-ray\nspectra formed as a result of upscattering of the soft (disk) photons in the\nconverging inflow (CI) within about 3 Schwarzschild radii of the black hole.\nThe full relativistic treatment has been implemented to reproduce these\nspectra.

The new gap equation contains the effect of the kinetic\nenergy gain upon developing a superconducting order parameter. However, this\nnew kinetic energy gain mechanism works only for a repulsive pairing potential\nleading to a s-wave state. In this case, compared to the usual potential energy\ngain in the superconducting state as in the BCS gap equation, the kinetic\nenergy gain is more effective to easily achieve a high critical temperature\n$T_c$, since it is naturally Fermi energy scale. In view of the experimental\nevidences of the d-wave pairing state in the hole-doped copper-oxide high-$T_c$\nsuperconductors, we discuss the implications of our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 1998 10:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
