The origin of the radio emission, however, has remained unclear,\nespecially in volume-limited samples that select intrinsically less luminous\ngalaxies. Both active galactic nuclei and nuclear star formation have been\nsuggested as possible mechanisms for producing the radio emission. This paper\nutilizes optical spectroscopic information to address this issue. A substantial\nfraction of the early-type galaxies surveyed with the Very Large Array by\nWrobel & Heeschen (1991) exhibits detectable optical emission lines in their\nnuclei down to very sensitive limits. Comparison of the observed radio\ncontinuum power with that expected from the thermal gas traced by the optical\nemission lines implies that the bulk of the radio emission is nonthermal. Both\nthe incidence and the strength of optical line emission correlate with the\nradio power. At a fixed line luminosity, ellipticals have stronger radio cores\nthan S0s. The relation between radio power and line emission observed in this\nsample is consistent with the low-luminosity extension of similar relations\nseen in classical radio galaxies and luminous Seyfert nuclei. A plausible\ninterpretation of this result is that the weak nuclear sources in nearby\nearly-type galaxies are the low-luminosity counterparts of more powerful AGNs.\nThe spectroscopic evidence supports this picture. Most of the emission-line\nobjects are optically classified as Seyfert nuclei or low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line regions (LINERs), the majority of which are likely to be\naccretion-powered sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 1998 17:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Their origin could be\ninverse Compton (IC) emission by relativistic electrons. The scattered photon\nfields can either be the CMB or the starlight of the galaxies within the\ncluster. If the EUV excess is due to CMB-IC, a strongly inhomogeneous\nmagnetized intra- cluster medium (ICM) is required, in which the density of the\nrelativistic electrons is anticorrelated with the magnetic fields. This could\nbe understood if the electrons were accelerated during a major merger event\nwithin the last 2 Gyr and cooled afterwards in the inhomogeneous fields. If the\nEUV excess is due to starlight-IC, a population of relativistic, very low\nenergy electrons has to be present, with a high energy density. In order to\nsurvive Coulomb losses, these electrons have to be separated from the cluster\ngas by confining magnetic fields. This could be remnant radio plasma from the\nepoch of violent quasar activity. The observed narrow radial profile of the EUV\nexcess emission is due to the narrow photon distribution for this model. Both\nmodels favor very inhomogeneous magnetic field and relativistic electron\ndistributions. IC models for the HEX excess seem to be implausible: CMB-IC\nleads to a mainly unmagnetized ICM, in contradiction to Faraday rotation\nmeasurements. Starlight scattering electrons would overproduce EUV photons due\nto simultaneously CMB-IC. We propose that the observed HEX excess is due to\nbremsstrahlung of a small high energy power-law tail of the mainly thermal ICM\nelectron distribution.

In this\npaper, we focus on the inner centrifugally-supported disk, which is formed only\nafter a central protostar exists, and grows by dynamical accretion from the\nflattened envelope. We estimate a centrifugal radius for the collapse of mass\nshells within a rotating, magnetized cloud core. The centrifugal radius of the\ninner disk is related to its mass through the two important parameters\ncharacterizing the background medium: the background rotation rate $\\Omb$ and\nthe background magnetic field strength $\\Bref$. We also revisit the issue of\nhow rapidly mass is deposited onto the disk (the mass accretion rate) and use\nseveral recent models to comment upon the likely outcome in magnetized cores.\nOur model predicts that a significant centrifugal disk (much larger than a\nstellar radius) will be present in the very early (Class 0) stage of\nprotostellar evolution. Additionally, we derive an upper limit for the disk\nradius as it evolves due to internal torques, under the assumption that the\nstar-disk system conserves its mass and angular momentum even while most of the\nmass is transferred to a central star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 1998 15:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
