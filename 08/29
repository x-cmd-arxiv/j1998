In recent years, a number of different semantics\nfor defaults have been proposed, such as preferential structures,\n$\\epsilon$-semantics, possibilistic structures, and $\\kappa$-rankings, that\nhave been shown to be characterized by the same set of axioms, known as the KLM\nproperties.

In the framework of plausibility measures, we can give a necessary\ncondition for the KLM axioms to be sound, and an additional condition necessary\nand sufficient to ensure that the KLM axioms are complete. This additional\ncondition is so weak that it is almost always met whenever the axioms are\nsound.
