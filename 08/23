The extended emission can be understood as a\ncompact, absorbed core at the location of the X-ray binary, and extended\nemission up to 2 arcsec to the southeast of the core. The arcsec-scale extended\nemission aligns with the larger, more symmetric arcmin-scale collimated\nstructures in the surrounding synchrotron nebula. This suggests that the\ntransport of mass and/or energy from the X-ray binary to the synchroton nebula\nis occurring via the arcsec-scale structures.
