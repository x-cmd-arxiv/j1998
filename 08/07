Several examples\nare then given of three-family neutrino mass textures which may also\naccommodate the persistent solar neutrino deficit, with different assumptions\nfor the neutrino Dirac mass matrices. We comment on a few features of neutrino\nmass textures arising in models with a U(1) flavour symmetry. Finally, we\ndiscuss the possible pattern of neutrino masses in a `realistic' flipped SU(5)\nmodel derived from string theory, illustrating how a desirable pattern of\nmixing may emerge. Both small- or large-angle MSW solutions are possible,\nwhilst a hierarchy of neutrino masses appears more natural than\nnear-degeneracy.

Define the {\\it\nstate} D of a link x=y as the joint probability distribution matrix on x and y\nwithout the link. The two core laws of quantum mechanics are the Born\nprobability rule, and the unitary dynamical law whose best known form is the\nSchrodinger's equation. Von Neumann formulated these two laws in the language\nof Hilbert space as prob(P) = trace(PD) and D'T = TD respectively, where P is a\nprojection, D and D' are (von Neumann) density matrices, and T is a unitary\ntransformation. We'll see that if we regard link states as density matrices,\nthe algebraic forms of these two core laws occur as completely general theorems\nabout links.
