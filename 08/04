Such gates provide a general source of spin\nentanglement and can be used for quantum computers. We determine the exchange\ncoupling J in the effective Heisenberg model as a function of magnetic (B) and\nelectric fields, and of the inter-dot distance (a) within the Heitler-London\napproximation of molecular physics. This result is refined by using\nsp-hybridization, and by the Hund-Mulliken molecular-orbit approach which leads\nto an extended Hubbard description for the two-dot system that shows a\nremarkable dependence on B and a due to the long-range Coulomb interaction. We\nfind that the exchange J changes sign at a finite field (leading to a\npronounced jump in the magnetization) and then decays exponentially. The\nmagnetization and the spin susceptibilities of the coupled dots are calculated.\nWe show that the dephasing due to nuclear spins in GaAs can be strongly\nsuppressed by dynamical nuclear spin polarization and/or by magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 1998 19:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 1998 13:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It has been shown that the given nequalities\ncan be hardly derived when the changing space position of photon-pair source\ntogether with the microscopic space structure of measuring devices are taken\ninto account; and when corresponding impact parameters (i.e., exact impact\npoints) of photons in individual measuring devices (polarizers) influence\nmeasured values, in addition to usually considered characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 1998 14:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
