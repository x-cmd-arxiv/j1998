We find that the autocorrelation\nfunction of the random force decays rapidly: the process is therefore Markov\nfor scales larger than Kolmogorov's dissipation scale $\\eta$. The corresponding\nautocorrelation scale is identified as the elementary step of the energy\ncascade. However, the probability distribution function of the random force is\nboth non-Gaussian and weakly scale-dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 1998 06:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

One funnel ends in the global minimum, a face-centred-cubic (fcc)\ntruncated octahedron. At the bottom of the other funnel is the second lowest\nenergy minimum which is an incomplete Mackay icosahedron. We characterize the\nenergy landscape in two ways. Firstly, from a large sample of minima and\ntransition states we construct a disconnectivity tree showing which minima are\nconnected below certain energy thresholds. Secondly we compute the free energy\nas a function of a bond-order parameter. The free energy profile has two\nminima, one which corresponds to the fcc funnel and the other which at low\ntemperature corresponds to the icosahedral funnel and at higher temperatures to\nthe liquid-like state. These two approaches show that the greater width of the\nicosahedral funnel, and the greater structural similarity between the\nicosahedral structures and those associated with the liquid-like state, are the\ncause of the smaller free energy barrier for entering the icosahedral funnel\nfrom the liquid-like state and therefore of the cluster's preferential entry\ninto this funnel on relaxation down the energy landscape. Furthermore, the\nlarge free energy barrier between the fcc and icosahedral funnels, which is\nenergetic in origin, causes the cluster to be trapped in one of the funnels at\nlow temperature.
