This conclusion holds in all currently popular\nhierarchical models for structure formation, and is almost independent of the\nglobal cosmological parameters. We examine whether the sizes, luminosities,\nkinematics and star-formation rates of LBGs are also consistent with this\nidentification. Simple formation models tuned to give good fits to low redshift\ngalaxies can predict the distribution of these quantities in the LBG\npopulation. The LBGs should be small (with typical half-light radii of 0.6-2\nkpc/h), should inhabit haloes of moderately high circular velocity (180-290\nkm/s) but have low stellar velocity dispersions (70-120 km/s) and should have\nsubstantial star formation rates (15-100 Msun/yr). The numbers here refer to\nthe predicted median values in the LBG sample of Adelberger et al. (1998); the\nfirst assumes an Omega=1 universe and the second a flat universe with\nOmega=0.3. For either cosmology these predictions are consistent with the\ncurrent (rather limited) observational data. Following the work of Kennicutt\n(1998) we assume stars to form more rapidly in gas of higher surface density.\nThis predicts that LBG samples should preferentially contain objects with low\nangular momentum, and so small size, for their mass. In contrast, samples of\ndamped Lyman alpha systems (DLSs), should be biased towards objects with large\nangular momentum. Bright LBGs and DLSs may therefore form distinct populations,\nwith very different sizes and star formation rates, LBGs being smaller and more\nmetal-rich than DLSs of similar mass and redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 1998 16:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
