We consider Liouville field theory on world sheets whose boundaries\nare the Wilson loops of gauge theory, which exhibit vortex and spike defects.\nWe show that world-sheet vortex condensation occurs when the Wilson loop is\nembedded in four target space-time dimensions, and show that this corresponds\nto the condensation of gauge magnetic monopoles in target space. We also show\nthat vortex condensation generates a effective string tension corresponding to\nthe confinement of electric degrees of freedom. The tension is independent of\nthe string length in a gauge theory whose electric coupling varies\nlogarithmically with the length scale. The Liouville field is naturally\ninterpreted as an extra target dimension, with an anti-de-Sitter (AdS)\nstructure induced by recoil effects on the gauge monopoles, interpreted as D\nbranes of the effective string theory. Black holes in the bulk AdS space\ncorrespond to world-sheet defects, so that phases of the bulk gravitational\nsystem correspond to the different world-sheet phases, and hence to different\nphases of the four-dimensional gauge theory.

An analysis is given in the\nframework of the phenomenological restricted path integral approach (RPI)\n(which reduces effectively to a Schrodinger equation with a complex\nHamiltonian) as well as with reference to the microphysical details of a class\nof concrete physical realizations. Within the RPI approach it is demonstrated\nthat for appropriately adjusted fuzziness, information about the evolution of\nthe state of the system can be read off from the measurement readout E(t). It\nis shown furthermore how a measurement of this type may be realized by a series\nof weak and short interactions of the two-level system with a quantum\nmechanical meter system. After each interaction a macroscopic measuring\napparatus causes the meter to transit into one of two states. The result is\nused to generate the energy readout E(t). In this way a complete agreement with\nthe RPI approach is demonstrated which thus obtains an operational\ninterpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 1998 12:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 1998 17:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
