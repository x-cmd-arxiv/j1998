The present values of the Hubble constant derived through the SZ/X-ray\nroute have a broad distribution ranging from 30 to 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. We show\nthat this broad distribution is primarily due to the projection effect of\naspherical clusters, which have been modeled using spherical geometries. The\nprojection effect is also expected to broaden the measured gas mass fraction of\ngalaxy clusters. However, the projection effect either under- or overestimate\nthe Hubble constant and the gas mass fraction in an opposite manner, producing\nan anticorrelation. Using the published data for SZ/X-ray clusters, we show\nthat the current Hubble constant distribution is negatively correlated with the\nmeasured gas mass fraction for same clusters, suggesting that the projection\neffects are present in current results. If the gas mass fraction of galaxy\nclusters, when measured out to an outer hydrostatic radius is constant, it may\nbe possible to account for the line of sight geometry of galaxy clusters.\nHowever, to perform such an analysis, an independent measurement of the total\nmass of galaxy clusters, such as from weak lensing, is needed.

Evaluated for a set of\nparameters which are mainly suitable for protostellar jets (with density ratios\nbetween the jet and the ambient medium 3-10, and ambient Mach number ~ 24),\nthese simulations are also compared with baseline non-magnetic and adiabatic\ncalculations. We find that, after amplification by compression and\nre-orientation in nonparallel shocks at the working surface, the magnetic field\nthat is carried backward with the shocked gas into the cocoon improves the jet\ncollimation relative to the purely hydrodynamic (HD) systems. Low-amplitude,\napproximately equally spaced internal shocks (which are absent in the HD\nsystems) are produced by MHD K-H reflection pinch modes. The longitudinal field\ngeometry also excites non-axisymmetric helical modes which cause some beam\nwiggling. The strength and amount of these modes are, however, reduced (by ~\ntwice) in the presence of radiative cooling relative to the adiabatic cases.\nBesides, a large density ratio between the jet and the ambient medium also\nreduces, in general, the number of the internal shocks. As a consequence, the\nweakness of the induced internal shocks makes it doubtful that the magnetic\npinches could produce by themselves the bright knots observed in the overdense,\nradiatively cooling protostellar jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 1998 14:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

More generally, it may account for the\nsimultaneous measurements of velocity distributions corresponding to slits\npresenting arbitrary orientations with respect to the major axis. The approach\nis non-parametric, i.e. it does not rely on a particular algebraic model for\nthe distribution function. Special care is taken to account for the fraction of\ncounter-rotating stars which strongly affects the stability of the disk.

At zero\ntemperature, even though the thermal fluctuations are absent, quantum fields\nstill possess vacuum fluctuations. It is then interesting to ask whether a\nsmall particle that is interacting with a quantum field will exhibit Brownian\nmotion when the quantum field is assumed to be in the vacuum state. In this\npaper, we study the cases of a small charge and an imperfect mirror interacting\nwith a quantum scalar field in (1+1) dimensions. Treating the quantum field as\na classical stochastic variable, we write down a Langevin equation for the\nparticles. We show that the results we obtain from such an approach agree with\nthe results obtained from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Unlike the\nfinite temperature case, there exists no special frame of reference at zero\ntemperature and hence it is essential that the particles do not break Lorentz\ninvariance. We find that that the scalar charge breaks Lorentz invariance,\nwhereas the imperfect mirror does not. We conclude that small particles such as\nthe imperfect mirror {\\it will} exhibit Brownian motion even in the quantum\nvacuum, but this effect can be so small that it may prove to be difficult to\nobserve it experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 1998 10:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 1999 01:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
