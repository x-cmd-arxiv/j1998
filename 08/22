The fundamental\nPlanck mass is at a TeV and the observed weakness of gravity at long distances\nis due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. In this letter,\nwe study how the properties of black holes are altered in these theories. Small\nblack holes---with Schwarzschild radii smaller than the size of the new spatial\ndimensions---are quite different. They are bigger, colder, and longer-lived\nthan a usual $(3+1)$-dimensional black hole of the same mass. Furthermore, they\nprimarily decay into harmless bulk graviton modes rather than standard-model\ndegrees of freedom. We discuss the interplay of our scenario with the\nholographic principle. Our results also have implications for the bounds on the\nspectrum of primordial black holes (PBHs) derived from the photo-dissociation\nof primordial nucleosynthesis products, distortion of the diffuse gamma-ray\nspectrum, overclosure of the universe, gravitational lensing, as well as the\nphenomenology of black hole production. For example, the bound on the spectral\nindex of the primordial spectrum of density perturbations is relaxed from 1.25\nto 1.45-1.60 depending on the epoch of the PBH formation. In these scenarios\nPBHs provide interesting dark matter candidates; for 6 extra dimensions MACHO\ncandidates with mass $\\sim 0.1M_\\odot$ can arise. For 2 or 3 extra dimensions\nPBHs with mass $\\sim 2000 M_\\odot$ can occur and may act as both dark matter\nand seeds for early galaxy and QSO formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 1998 22:54:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We first consider the case of compact toroidal $Z_N$ Type IIB\norientifolds and then proceed to the non-compact case of Type IIB D3 branes at\norbifold and orientifold singularities. Unlike the case of the heterotic string\nwe find that for each given vacuum one has generically more than one U(1) with\nnon-vanishing triangle anomalies. There is a generalized Green-Schwarz\nmechanism by which these anomalies are cancelled. This involves only the\nRamond-Ramond scalars coming from the twisted closed string spectrum but not\nthose coming from the untwisted sector. Associated to the anomalous U(1)'s\nthere are field-dependent Fayet-Illiopoulos terms whose mass scale is fixed by\nundetermined vev's of the NS-NS partners of the relevant twisted RR fields.\nThus, unlike what happens in heterotic vacua, the masses of the anomalous\nU(1)'s gauge bosons may be arbitrarily light. In the case of D3 branes at\nsingularities, appropriate factorization of the U(1)'s constrains the\nChan-Paton matrices beyond the restrictions from cancellation of non-abelian\nanomalies. These conditions can be translated to constraints on the T-dual Type\nIIB brane box configurations.
