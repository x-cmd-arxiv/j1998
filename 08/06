The conversion efficiency of the Raman\nscattering process is discussed and the expected scattered flux is computed\nusing the spectral energy distribution of an AGN given by a typical power law.\nThe high column H {\\sc i} component in AGN is suggested by many observations\nencompassing radio through UV and X-ray ranges.
