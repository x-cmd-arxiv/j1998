In this model, two separate layers of\nneurons are connected together. The number of neurons in both layers and\nconnections between them is the product of the number of all elements of input\nsignals and the number of possible classification of the data. With this\nstructure the conventional repeated learning procedure is modified to learn\njust once. The once learning manner is more similar to human learning and\nmemorizing activities. During training, weight updating is managed through a\nsequence of operations among some transformation and operation matrices. Every\nconnection between neurons of input/output layers is considered as a\nindependent processor. In this way, all elements of the Euclidean distance\nmatrix and weight matrix are calculated simultaneously. The minimum distance of\nevery line of distance matrix can be found by Grover's search algorithm. This\nsynchronization feature improves the weight updating sequence significantly.\nWith a typical classification example, the convergence result demonstrates\nefficient performance of Parallel-SOM. Theoretic analysis and proofs also show\nsome important properties of proposed model.
