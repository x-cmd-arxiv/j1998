Given\nour present state of knowledge, this is a difficult question to answer. We\ntherefore begin by asking a more narrowly focused question: are conditions on\nplanets discovered via microlensing likely to be similar to those we experience\non Earth? In this paper I link the microlensing observations to the well-known\n\"Goldilocks Problem\" (conditions on the Earth-like planets need to be \"just\nright\"), to find that Earth-like planets discovered via microlensing are likely\nto be orbiting stars more luminous than the sun. This means that light from the\nplanetary system's central star may contribute a significant fraction of the\nbaseline flux relative to the star that is lensed. Such blending of light from\nthe lens with light from the lensed source can, in principle, limit our ability\nto detect these events. This turns out not to be a significant problem,\nhowever. A second consequence of blending is the opportunity to determine the\nspectral type of the lensed spectral type of the lensed star. This\ncircumstance, plus the possibility that finite-source-size effects are\nimportant, implies that some meaningful follow-up observations are likely to be\npossible for a subset Earth-like planets discovered via microlensing. In\naddition, calculations indicate that reasonable requirements on the planet's\ndensity and surface gravity imply that the mass of Earth-like planets is likely\nto be within a factor of $\\sim 15$ of an Earth mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 1998 01:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

We perform\nin this model explicit calculations of S-matrix elements between quark states,\nat tree level, one loop, and two loops, and discuss issues of renormalisability\nand unitarity. In particular, it is shown that the S-matrix element for quark\nscattering is renormalisable at one-loop order and is only logarithmically\nnon-renormalisable at two loops. The discrepancies in the ultraviolet regime\nbetween the one-loop predictions of this model and those of massless QCD are\ndiscussed in detail.

In particular, the conformal\ndimensions and the central charge of the chiral $SU(N)_{k}$ models are\ncalculated from their braid matrices. Futhermore, at level K=2, we present the\ncharacteristic polynomials of their fusion matrices in a factored form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 1998 14:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
