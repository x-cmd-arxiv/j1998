Pulse frequencies of 15.0941 +/- 0.0002 mHz on 1993 June 25 (MJD\n49,163) and 15.0882 +/- 0.0002 mHz on 1997 July 12 (MJD 50,641) were each\nmeasured from 2 day spans of BATSE data near each outburst's peak. Cep X-4\nshowed an average spin down rate of (-4.14 +/- 0.08)*10^(-14) Hz/s between the\n1993 and 1997 outbursts. After BATSE could no longer detect Cep X-4, public\nobservations were performed on 1997 July 18 & 25 with the Proportional Counter\nArray (PCA) on RXTE. A pulse frequency of 15.088 +/- 0.004 mHz was measured\nfrom observations on 1997 July 18 (MJD 50,647). Significant aperiodic noise,\nwith an rms variance of ~18% in the frequency range 0.01-1.0 Hz was observed on\nboth days. Energy and intensity dependent pulse shape variations were also seen\nin these data. Recently published optical observations associate Cep X-4 with a\nBe companion star. If all 4 outbursts observed from Cep X-4 are assumed to\noccur at the same orbital phase, we find that the orbital period is between 23\ndays and 147.3 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 1998 15:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
