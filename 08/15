This results in the appearance\nof specific features in the inflaton effective potential which, in turn, lead\nto the generation of localized spikes in the primordial perturbation spectrum.\nAt present, there seems to exist one scale in the spectrum, $k=0.05h$\nMpc$^{-1}$, around which we might see something of this type. The second one is\nthe possibility that we are living at the beginning of a new inflation-like era\nnow. Then observations of clustering of high-redshift objects can provide\ninformation sufficient for the unambiguous determination of the effective\npotential of a corresponding present inflaton scalar field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 1998 16:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
