In this paper, we\nstudy the nature of GRB hosts expected in this scenario. We improve upon\nprevious studies by incorporating a luminosity function for the GRBs, as\nrequired by observations. This model provides a good match to the observed\nnumber counts of GRBs as a function of peak-count rate. The model predicts that\nthe host galaxies have their redshift distribution peaked around z~1, and about\n15 percent have z>2.5. This high-redshift fraction have the same properties as\nthe star-forming galaxies recently discovered by the Lyman-break technique. At\nz<~1, many of the GRBs may be hosted by faint blue galaxies. Using a\nphotometric redshift sample of galaxies from the Hubble Deep Field, we find\nthat the host galaxies have magnitudes in the range from 21.5 to 28 in the\nI-band, and about 90 percent of them have semi-major axis smaller than 1.3\narcsec. Assuming isotropic emission, the typical peak-luminosity and total\nenergy of GRBs are in an Einstein-de Sitter universe with H_0=100km/s/Mpc. We\nalso discuss further observational tests of this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 1998 16:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown from first principle physics that stars have a non-pp,CNO\nsource: local thermonuclear runaways. I derive a model independent inequality,\nwhich shows that the problem of the missing beryllium neutrinos lies in that\nthe SuperKamiokande contains a term arising from neutrinos from a runaway\nsource which can produce high-energy electrons and high-energy axions, and muon\nand tau neutrinos. I point out, that the temperature dependence of the\nindividual neutrino fluxes is related to pure nuclear physics but the usual\nluminosity constraint is model dependent and actually is a questionable\nassumption. Allowing non-pp,CNO reaction chains a new approach arises to\ninterpret the neutrino detector data. The explicit temperature dependence leads\nto $\\Phi_{pp} \\propto T^4$ instead of the usual $\\Phi_{pp} \\propto T^{-1/2}$\nfor the SSM luminosity constraint. I assume a Sun analogue to the SSM with a\ndifferent $T_c$. The separate neutrino detector equations lead to separate\ndetector-related temperatures with the neutrino detector data.

A given nucleon is limited to one-dimensional motion in a\ndistribution of external, spin-dependent scattering potentials. We calculate\nthe nucleon spin autocorrelation function numerically for a variety of\npotential densities and distributions which are meant to bracket realistic\nconditions in a supernova core. For all plausible configurations the width of\nthe spin-density structure function is found to be less than the temperature.\nThis is in contrast with a naive perturbative calculation based on the one-pion\nexchange potential which overestimates the width and thus suggests a large\nsuppression of the neutrino opacities by nucleon spin fluctuations. Our results\nsuggest that it may be justified to neglect the collisional broadening of the\nspin-density structure function for the purpose of estimating the neutrino\nopacities in the deep inner core of a supernova.

Whenever these two quantities vanish, asymptotically weak\nstabilization does exist. For all other situations we did not find any evidence\nfor stabilization. We found no evidence that strong stabilization might occur.\nOur results agree qualitatively with the existing experimental findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 1998 15:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 1998 15:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For distances much longer than the coherence length of a\ncorresponding noisy quantum channel, the fidelity of transmission is usually so\nlow that standard purification methods are not applicable. It is however\npossible to divide the channel into shorter segments that are purified\nseparately and then connected by the method of entanglement swapping. This\nmethod can be much more efficient than schemes based on quantum error\ncorrection, as it makes explicit use of two-way classical communication. An\nimportant question is how the noise, introduced by imperfect local operations\n(that constitute the protocols of purification and the entanglement swapping),\naccumulates in such a compound channel, and how it can be kept below a certain\nnoise level. To treat this problem, we first study the applicability and the\nefficiency of entanglement purification protocols in the situation of imperfect\nlocal operations. We then present a scheme that allows entanglement\npurification over arbitrary long channels and tolerates errors on the per-cent\nlevel. It requires a polynomial overhead in time, and an overhead in local\nresources that grows only logarithmically with the length of the channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 1998 10:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
