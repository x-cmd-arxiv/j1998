The major trends found are that (i) spectral indices increase with\nlinear size, (ii) rest-frame spectral indices have a stronger dependence on\nluminosity than on redshift except at high (GHz) frequencies, and that (iii)\nthe linear sizes are smaller at higher redshifts. We reproduce the observed\ndependences in a model for radio sources (born throughout cosmic time according\nto a radio-source birth function) whose lobes are fed with a\nsynchrotron-emitting population (whose energy distribution is governed by\ncompact hotspots), and which suffer inverse Compton, synchrotron and adiabatic\nexpansion losses.

We find\nadditional ambiguous terms of order hbar^2 involving freedom in the\nconstraining potentials, demonstrating that the classical constrained\nHamiltonian or Lagrangian cannot uniquely specify the quantization: the\nambiguity of directly quantizing a constrained system is inherently\nunresolvable. However, there is never any problem with a physical quantum\nsystem, which cannot have infinite constraint forces and always fluctuates\naround the mean constraint values. The issue is addressed from the perspectives\nof adiabatic approximations in quantum mechanics, Feynman path integrals, and\nsemiclassically in terms of adiabatic actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 1998 21:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-14"}
