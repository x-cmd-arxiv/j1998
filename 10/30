Pseudogap\nformations have been observed in both the density of states and the spectral\nfunction at the Fermi level. The pseudogap in the spectral function is\nexplained by the non-Fermi-liquid-like nature of the self-energy. The anomalous\nbehavior in the self-energy is caused by both the strong antiferromagnetic spin\nfluctuation and the nesting condition on the non-interacting Fermi surface.

This anomaly is intimately\nassociated with the $\\eta^\\prime$ meson, which gets its mass from it. When the\ngauge degrees of freedom of QCD are confined within a volume as is presently\nunderstood, the $U_A(1)$ anomaly is known to induce color anomaly leading to\n\"leakage\" of the color out of the confined volume (or bag). For consistency of\nthe theory, this anomaly should be canceled by a boundary term. This ``color\nboundary term\" inherits part or most of the dynamics of the volume (i.e., QCD).\nIn this paper, we exploit this mapping of the volume to the surafce via the\ncolor boundary condition to perform a complete analysis of the flavor singlet\naxial charge in the chiral bag model using the Cheshire Cat Principle.

In addition to the well established universality with\nrespect to the choice of potential, we prove that microscopic spectral\ncorrelators are unaffected when the matrix in the determinant is replaced by an\nexpansion in powers of the matrix. We refer to this invariance as logarithmic\nuniversality. The result is used in proving that a simple random matrix model\nwith Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry has the same microscopic spectral correlators as\nchiral random matrix theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 1998 13:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
