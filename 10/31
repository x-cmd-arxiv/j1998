It is proposed that the gamma-ray bursts occur primarily in the star\nformation regions in starburst environments, and arise from the core-collapse\nof super-massive Wolf-Rayet stars, that are formed in interacting systems. In\nthis interacting environment star formations cause supernovae explosions. As\nthe stars explode, shock waves propagate outward and collide with the ambient\nmedium, forming a high-density super-shell, where intense star formation\nbegins; subsequently supernovae explosions within the shell cause an outward\nexpansion of the shell. In another scenario of star formation the interactions\namong the large gas-rich low-surface brightness (LSB) spiral galaxies give rise\nto fragmentation of their tidal tails. These fragmented clouds collapse to\ncompact dwarfs, which undergo rapid star formation. In such a scenario of\ninteractions, where most quasars are observed, we discuss the MgII absorption\nlines in GRB 970508, whose spectra resemble a BL Lac object, and the spectral\nevolution of GRB 971214 that may also indicate a similar connection. Beside the\nBL Lac connection, the recent discovery of GRB 980425 in a nearby galaxy\nindicates asymmetric supernovae explosions that give rise to relativistic jets.\nWe propose that the gamma-ray light curves arise due to inverse Compton\nscattering of soft-photons from precessing relativistic blobs of plasma moving\nin jets.

We\ninvestigate the effect of including a bursting mode of star formation, assuming\nthat galaxy-galaxy mergers trigger starbursts and using the merger rate that\narises naturally in the CDM merging hierarchy. The resulting starbursts\nsubstantially increase the global star formation rate at high redshift, leading\nto predictions that are in good agreement with the star formation rate density\nat $z\\sim3$ obtained from sub-millimeter observations (SCUBA) and optical/UV\nestimates after correction for dust extinction.

The foundation of the approach is the construction of several\nfamilies of novel distances (metrics) between neuronal impulse trains. In\ncontrast to most previous approaches to the analysis of temporal coding, the\npresent approach does not attempt to embed impulse trains in a vector space,\nand does not assume a Euclidean notion of distance. Rather, the proposed\nmetrics formalize physiologically-based hypotheses for what aspects of the\nfiring pattern might be stimulus-dependent, and make essential use of the point\nprocess nature of neural discharges. We show that these families of metrics\nendow the space of impulse trains with related but inequivalent topological\nstructures. We show how these metrics can be used to determine whether a set of\nobserved responses have stimulus-dependent temporal structure without a\nvector-space embedding. We show how multidimensional scaling can be used to\nassess the similarity of these metrics to Euclidean distances. For two of these\nfamilies of metrics (one based on spike times and one based on spike\nintervals), we present highly efficient computational algorithms for\ncalculating the distances. We illustrate these ideas by application to\nartificial datasets and to recordings from auditory and visual cortex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 1998 22:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
