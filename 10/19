The cold clouds\ncould remain relatively static until they are destroyed by evaporation or\nablation, or give rise to star formation. If the final fate of the clouds is\nstars, the IMF of the stars formed over the whole cooling flow region ($r \\sim\n100$ kpc) should be biased to low masses, to avoid a very luminous, blue halo\nfor the central galaxy of the cooling flow. However, there is evidence for\nbright star formation in the innermost (r < 10 kpc) regions of some cooling\nflows, and, therefore, the biasing of the IMF towards low masses should not\noccur or be less important at smaller radii. The consideration of magnetic\nfields may shed light on these two points. If magnetic fields are present, the\nmagnetic critical mass should be considered, besides the Jeans mass, in\nestablishing a natural mass scale for star formation.
