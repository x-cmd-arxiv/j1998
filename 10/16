Recently, Genzel et al. made mid-infrared (MIR)\nspectroscopy of a large number of ULIGs and found that the major energy source\nin them is massive stars formed in the recent starburst activity; i.e., $\\sim$\n70% -- 80% of the sample are predominantly powered by the starburst. However,\nit is known that previous optical spectroscopic observations showed that the\nmajority of ULIGs are classified as Seyferts or LINERs (low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line regions). In order to reconcile this difference, we compare types\nof emission-line activity for a sample of ULIGs which have been observed in\nboth optical and MIR. We confirm the results of previous studies that the\nmajority of ULIGs classified as LINERs based on the optical emission-line\ndiagnostics turn to be starburst-dominated galaxies based on the MIR ones.\nSince the MIR spectroscopy can probe more heavily-reddened, inner parts of the\nULIGs, it is quite unlikely that the inner parts are powered by the starburst\nwhile the outer parts are powered by non-stellar ionization sources. The most\nprobable resolution of this dilemma is that the optical emission-line nebulae\nwith the LINER properties are powered predominantly by shock heating driven by\nthe superwind activity; i.e., a blast wave driven by a collective effect of a\nlarge number of supernovae in the central region of galaxy mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 1998 01:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

For the other mass ranges, the dilaton either undercloses or overcloses\nthe universe. The 0.5 keV dilaton has the free-streaming distance of about 1.4\nMpc and becomes an excellent candidate of a warm dark matter, while the 270 MeV\none has the free-streaming distance of about 7.4 pc and becomes a cold dark\nmatter.

When recoil effects are included, spatial\nmodulation of the atomic density can occur for times that are greater than or\ncomparable with the inverse recoil frequency. In this regime, the atoms exhibit\nmatter-wave interference. Two specific atom field geometries are considered. In\nthe first, atoms characterized by a homogeneous velocity distribution are\nsubjected to a single radiation pulse. The pulse excites the atoms which then\ndecay back to the lower state. The spatial modulation of the total atomic\ndensity is calculated as a function of $t$, where $t$ is the time following the\npulse. In contrast to the normal Talbot effect, the spatially modulated density\nis not a periodic function of $ t,$ owing to spontaneous emission; however,\nafter a sufficiently long time, the contribution from spontaneous processes no\nlonger plays a role and the Talbot periodicity is restored. In the second\natom-field geometry, there are two pulses separated by an interval $T$. The\natomic velocity distribution in this case is assumed to be inhomogeneously\nbroadened. In contrast to the normal Talbot-Lau effect, the spatially modulated\ndensity is not a periodic function of $T$, owing to spontaneous emission;\nhowever, for sufficiently long time, the contribution from spontaneous\nprocesses no longer plays a role and the Talbot periodicity is restored.

Then, we show that\nthe same effect is not valid for the tunnelling time mean-square fluctuations.\nOn the basis of the Hartman-Fletcher effect and the known analogy between\nphoton and nonrelativistic-particle tunnelling, one can explain the\nSuperluminal group-velocities observed in various photon tunnelling experiments\n(without violation of the so-called \"Einstein causality\").\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 1998 15:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
