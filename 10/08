Complete finite equational axiomatizations are given for five\nnotions of bisimulation congruence over basic CCS with flat iteration, viz.\nstrong congruence, branching congruence, eta-congruence, delay congruence and\nweak congruence. Such axiomatizations were already known for prefix iteration\nand are known not to exist for general iteration. The use of flat iteration has\ntwo main advantages over prefix iteration: 1.The current axiomatizations\ngeneralize to full CCS, whereas the prefix iteration approach does not allow an\nelimination theorem for an asynchronous parallel composition operator. 2.The\ngreater expressiveness of flat iteration allows for much shorter completeness\nproofs.\n  In the setting of prefix iteration, the most convenient way to obtain the\ncompleteness theorems for eta-, delay, and weak congruence was by reduction to\nthe completeness theorem for branching congruence. In the case of weak\ncongruence this turned out to be much simpler than the only direct proof found.\nIn the setting of flat iteration on the other hand, the completeness theorems\nfor delay and weak (but not eta-) congruence can equally well be obtained by\nreduction to the one for strong congruence, without using branching congruence\nas an intermediate step.

I consider the\nconjectures of the derived model for the solar neutrino fluxes in case of a\nsolar core allowed to vary in relation to the surface activity cycle. The\nobserved neutrino flux data suggest a solar core possibly varying in time. In\nthe dynamic solar model the quiet and runaway energy sources together may\nproduce quasi-constant flux in the SuperKamiokande because it is sensitive to\nneutral currents, axions and anti-neutrinos, too.

Activity correlated changes are expected to be present\nonly marginally in the GALLEX and GNO data. The gallium detectors are sensitive\nmostly to the pp neutrinos, and the changes of the pp neutrinos arising from\nthe SSM-like core is mostly compensated by the high-energy electron neutrinos\nproduced by the hot bubbles of the dynamic energy source.

In the context of the\nsupersymmetric unified theories, they further imply a non-trivial mass\nstructure for the scalar partners, giving rise to new sources of flavor\nviolation. In the present work, lepton flavor non-conserving processes are\nexamined in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model augmented\nby a U(1)-family symmetry. We calculate the mixing effects on the \\mu-> e\\gamma\nand \\tau -> \\mu\\gamma rare decays. All supersymmetric scalar masses involved in\nthe processes are determined at low energies using two loop renormalization\ngroup analysis and threshold corrections. Further, various novel effects are\nconsidered and found to have important impact on the branching ratios. Thus, a\nrather interesting result is that when the see-saw mechanism is applied in the\n(12 X 12)-sneutrino mass matrix, the mixing effects of the Dirac matrix in the\neffective light sneutrino sector are canceled at first order. In this class of\nmodels and for the case that soft term mixing is already present at the GUT\nscale, tau -> \\mu \\gamma decays are mostly expected to arise at rates\nsignificantly smaller than the current experimental limits.
