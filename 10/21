We here investigate a related\nbut different problem. We consider an observer receiving light from an extended\nsource that has propagated in an arbitrary gravitational field. It is assumed\nfrom the start that the propagation is along null geodesics. Each point of the\nextended source is sending out a light-cones worth of null rays and the\nquestion arises which null rays from the source arrive first at the observer.\nStated in an a different fashion, a pulse of light comes from the source with a\nwave-front as the leading edge, which rays are associated with that leading\nedge. In vacuum flat-space we have, from Huygen's principle, that the rays\nnormal to the source constitute the leading edge and hence arrive first at an\nobserver.

Interestingly, the notorious `zero-mode'\nproblem is now tractable because of special supersymmetric cancellations. In\nparticular, we show that anomalous zero-mode contributions to the currents are\nabsent, in contrast to what is observed in the non-supersymmetric case. An\nanalysis of the vacuum structure is provided by deriving the effective quantum\nmechanical Hamiltonian of the gauge zero mode. It is shown that the inclusion\nof the zero modes of the adjoint scalars and fermions is crucial for probing\nthe phase properties of the vacua. We find that the ground state energy is zero\nand thus consistent with unbroken supersymmetry, and conclude that the\nlight-cone Fock vacuum is unchanged with or without the presence of matter\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 1998 13:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
