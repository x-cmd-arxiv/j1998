The BATSE detector on the COMPTON-GRO satellite\nhas been detecting one burst per day for the last six years. Its findings have\nrevolutionized our ideas about the nature of these objects. They have shown\nthat GRBs are at cosmological distances. This idea was accepted with\ndifficulties at first. The recent discovery of an X-ray afterglow by the\nItalian/Dutch satellite BeppoSAX has led to a detection of high red-shift\nabsorption lines in the optical afterglow of GRB970508 and in several other\nbursts and to the identification of host galaxies to others. This has confirmed\nthe cosmological origin. Cosmological GRBs release $\\sim 10^{51}-10^{53}$ergs\nin a few seconds making them the most (electromagnetically) luminous objects in\nthe Universe. The simplest, most conventional, and practically inevitable,\ninterpretation of these observations is that GRBs result from the conversion of\nthe kinetic energy of ultra-relativistic particles or possibly the\nelectromagnetic energy of a Poynting flux to radiation in an optically thin\nregion. This generic \"fireball\" model has also been confirmed by the afterglow\nobservations. The \"inner engine\" that accelerates the relativistic flow is\nhidden from direct observations. Consequently it is difficult to infer its\nstructure directly from current observations. Recent studies show, however,\nthat this ``inner engine'' is responsible for the complicated temporal\nstructure observed in GRBs. This temporal structure and energy considerations\nindicates that the ``inner engine'' is associated with the formation of a\ncompact object - most likely a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 1998 18:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The proof is based on the steepest decent method for\nRiemann-Hilbert problems, introduced by Deift and Zhou in 1993 [DZ1] in the\ncontext of integrable systems.
