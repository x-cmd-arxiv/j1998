The flow is characterized by a strong\ntail shock, which, unlike the Schwarzschild case, is increasingly wrapped\naround the central black hole as the hole angular momentum increases.

While the jets are produced in the\naccretion disk itself, the output power still is an increasing function of the\nblack hole angular momentum. For high enough spin, the black hole triggers the\nmagnetic switch, producing highly-relativistic, kinetic-energy-dominated jets\ninstead of Poynting-flux-dominated ones for lower spin. The coronal mass\ndensities needed to trigger the switch at the observed FR break power are quite\nsmall ($\\sim 10^{-15} g cm^{-3}$), implying that the source of the jet material\nmay be either a pair plasma or very tenuous electron-proton corona, not the\nmain accretion disk itself.\n  The model explains the differences in morphology and Mach number between FR I\nand II sources and the observed trend for massive galaxies to undergo the FR\nI/II transition at higher radio power. It also is consistent with the energy\ncontent of extended radio lobes and explains why, because of black hole\nspindown, the space density of FR II sources should evolve more rapidly than\nthat of FR I sources.\n  If the present model is correct, then the ensemble average speed of\nparsec-scale jets in sources distinguished by their FR I morphology (not\nluminosity) should be distinctly slower than that for sources with FR II\nmorphology.

In this paper we study\nthe case of high dimensional manifolds M with free abelian fundamental group.\nLet x be a non-zero element of H^1(M), let M(x) be the infinite cyclic cover\ncorresponding to x, and t be a generator of the structure group of this cover.\nSet M(x,k)=M(x)/t^k. We prove that the sequence m(M(x,k))/k converges as k goes\nto infinity. For x outside of a finite union of hyperplanes in H^1(M) we obtain\nthe asymptotics of m(M(x,k)) as k goes to infinity, in terms of homotopy\ninvariants of M related to Novikov homology of M.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 1998 11:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
