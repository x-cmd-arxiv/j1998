Our\nmethod uses reference models based on two equations of state currently used in\nsolar modeling, the Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen (MHD) equation of state, and the OPAL\nequation of state (developed at Livermore). Solar oscillation frequencies from\nthe SOI/MDI instrument on board the SOHO spacecraft during its first 144 days\nin operation are used. Our results confirm the existence of a subtle effect of\nthe excited states in hydrogen that was previously studied only theoretically\n(Nayfonov & Dappen 1998). The effect stems from internal partition function of\nhydrogen, as used in the MHD equation of state. Although it is a pure-hydrogen\neffect, it takes place in somewhat deeper layers of the Sun, where more than\n90% of hydrogen is ionized, and where the second ionization zone of helium is\nlocated. Therefore, the effect will have to be taken into account in reliable\nhelioseismic determinations of the astrophysically relevant helium-abundance of\nthe solar convection zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 1998 16:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 1998 13:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The distribution of flux decrements depends mainly\non the amplitude and PDF (Gaussian vs. non-Gaussian) of the primordial density\nfluctuations. The threshold crossing frequency, analogous to the 3-d genus\ncurve, responds to the shape and amplitude of P(k) and to the values of Omega\nand Lambda.

The change in the\naccretion disk inner radius during the outburst is in contrast to results from\nother soft X-ray transients. We find that the disk blackbody temperature\ndepends on the inner disk radius roughly as T=r^(-3/4).

They have HI linewidths significantly\nlarger than predicted by an extrapolation of the Tully-Fisher relation. The\ndeviation from the extrapolated Tully-Fisher relation correlates with the\ndistance-independent mass-to-luminosity ratio M_HI/L_B. The baryonic correction\nfor these gas rich galaxies is too small to explain the deviation from the\nTully-Fisher relation, unless a small mass-to-light ratio (M/L_B)_* <= 0.25 for\nthe stellar population is assumed. The second sample contains dwarf galaxies\nwith comparable rotational and random velocities. This sample, having Leo A as\na prototype, is consistent with an extrapolation of the classical Tully-Fisher\nrelation to lower luminosities. These dwarf galaxies are not particularly rich\nin gas, but their mass is dominated by baryonic matter within their HI radius.\nWe suggest that any evolution of the deviating galaxies towards the\nTully-Fisher relation will combine a decrease in linewidth by radial transport\nof HI with an increase in luminosity due to a larger accumulated stellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 1998 11:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It contains\nthe definition of quantum observables associated with Einstein localisation in\nspace-time as well as the evaluation of their commutation relations including\nthe energy-time relation. These commutators also describe the relativistic\nshifts undergone under frame transformations, not only for inertial frames but\nalso for uniformly accelerated frames. The quantum redshift laws differ from\ntheir classical counterparts while still obeying universal metric properties.\n  The paper presents this approach in terms closely connected to the seminal\nEinstein conception of localisation in space-time and refers to already\npublished papers for more technical developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 1998 10:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-02-27"}
