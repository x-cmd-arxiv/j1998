We concentrate on two\nmultiple-imaged sources at z=4.05 in the cluster A2390. The 2 objects presented\nin this paper, namely H3 and H5, were identified through lens modelling as\nmultiple images of high-redshift sources at z>3.5. We confirm the excellent\nagreement between this identification and both their photometric redshifts and\nmorphologies. Our CFHT/WHT program for a systematic redshift survey of arcs in\nclusters has allowed to obtain a set of spectra on 3 different images at z~4:\nthe brightest image of H3, which redshift was already confirmed by Frye &\nBroadhurst (1998), and the two brightest images of H5. The later is then\nconfirmed spectroscopically as a multiple image, giving a strong support to the\nlens model. The main feature in each of these spectra is a strong emission\nline, identified as Ly-alpha, leading to z=4.05 for both H3 and H5. The\nspectrophotometric properties of these galaxies are studied, in particular the\ndegeneracy in the parameter-space defined by the SFR type, age, metallicity and\nreddening. H3 and H5 are intrinsically bright and clumpy sources located ~100\nkpc part on the source plane, with mean metallicities compatible with a\nfraction of solar or even solar values. All these results seem to favour a\nhierarchical merging scenario, where we are actually seeing a relatively\nadvanced step for these 2 z~4 objects, with stars forming locally and\nefficiently from a preenriched gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 1998 16:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 1999 11:29:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 1999 08:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Multiple interference mechanisms are identified which may lead to\nfluorescence inhibition in well-separated regions of the spectrum or act\njointly in cancelling the spontaneous emission. In addition to phase\nindependent quantum interferences due to combined absorptions and emissions of\ndriving field photons, we distinguish two competing phase dependent\ninterference mechanisms as means of controlling the fluorescence. The\nindistinguishable quantum paths may involve the spontaneous emission from the\nsame state of the doublet, originating from the two different components of the\ninitial coherent superposition. Alternatively the paths involve a different\nspontaneous photon from each of two decaying states, necessarily with the same\npolarization. This makes these photons indistinguishable in principle within\nthe uncertainty of the two decay rates. The phase dependence arises for both\nmechanisms because the interfering paths differ by an unequal number of\nstimulated absorptions and emissions of the microwave field photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 1998 17:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
