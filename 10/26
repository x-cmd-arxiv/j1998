History quantum theories provide a conceptual and\nmathematical framework for formulating quantum theories without a globally\ndefined Hamiltonian time evolution and for introducing the concept of space\ntime event into quantum theory. On a mathematical level a history quantum\ntheory is characterized by the space of histories, which represent the space\ntime events, and by the space of decoherence functionals which represent the\nquantum mechanical states in the history approach. The second part of this\npaper is devoted to the study of the structure of the space of decoherence\nfunctionals for some physically reasonable spaces of histories in some detail.\nThe temporal reformulation of standard Hamiltonian quantum theories suggests to\nconsider the case that the space of histories is given by (i) the lattice of\nprojection operators on some Hilbert space or -- slightly more general -- (ii)\nthe set of projection operators in some von Neumann algebra. In the case (i)\nthe conditions are identified under which decoherence functionals can be\nrepresented by, respectively, trace class operators, bounded operators or\nfamilies of trace class operators on the tensor product of the underlying\nHilbert space by itself.

It is shown\nthat the spectral shape is directly related to the damping width of collective\nrotation, \\Gammarot, and to the spreading width of many-particle many-hole\nconfigurations, \\Gammamu. The rotational damping width is affected by the shell\nstructure, and is very sensitive to the position of the Fermi surface, besides\nmass number, spin and deformation. This produces a rich variety of features in\nthe rotational damping phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 1998 08:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
