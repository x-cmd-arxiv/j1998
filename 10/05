If all the lenses are in the Galactic halo, both the\nLMC and the SMC events are expected to have similar time scales. However, the\nfirst event towards the SMC, MACHO 97-SMC-1, had a time scale of 123 days which\nis much larger than the typical time scale for the LMC events. From optical\ndepth estimates, we first show that the stars within the SMC play a dominant\nrole as gravitational lenses and can fully account for the observed\nmicrolensing events, mainly due to its large physical depth. We also show that\nif the lenses are within the Magellanic Clouds, then the SMC events should be\nlonger in duration than the LMC events, a fact that is consistent with the\nobservations. The time scale of the event implies that the mass of the lens is\n>2 solar masses if it is in the Milky Way disk or halo, in which case the lens\nis expected to be bright and should reveal itself in the spectrum. Here, we\npresent an optical spectrum of MACHO 97-SMC-1 which shows that the lens is not\nin the Milky Way disk or halo, but is a low-mass star within the SMC. It is\nworth noting here that MACHO SMC-98-1 is the only OTHER observed event towards\nthe SMC. This was a binary lens event where the caustic crossing time-scale as\nobserved by PLANET, MACHO, EROS and OGLE collaborations, suggests that the lens\nis within the SMC. Furthermore, the only LMC event where the location of the\nlens is known is the binary lens event MACHO LMC-9, for which the lens is also\nwithin the LMC. Thus, ALL the 3 microlensing events towards the Magellanic\nClouds for which we have independent knowledge of the location of the lenses\nare due to self-lensing within the Magellanic Clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 1998 19:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

To\naddress these questions we review the continuum formalism of quantum gravity\nwith special focus on the scaling properties of the theory. We discuss several\nconcepts of fractal dimensions which characterize the extrinsic and intrinsic\ngeometry of quantum gravity. This work is partly based on work done in\ncollaboration with Jan Ambj{\\o}rn, Dimitrij Boulatov, Jakob L. Nielsen and\nYoshiyuki Watabiki (1997).\n  The other goal is the discussion of the discretization of quantum gravity and\nto address the so called quantum failure of Regge calculus. We review dynamical\ntriangulations and show that it agrees with the continuum theory in two\ndimensions. Then we discuss Regge calculus and prove that a continuum limit\ncannot be taken in a sensible way and that it does not reproduce continuum\nresults.
