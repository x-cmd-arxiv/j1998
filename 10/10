Such energetic particles can produce gamma-rays and lower\nenergy photons via interactions with the ambient plasma. In this paper, we\npresent results from a Monte Carlo simulation of non-linear shock structure and\nacceleration coupled with photon emission in shell-like SNRs. These\nnon-linearities are a by-product of the dynamical influence of the accelerated\ncosmic rays on the shocked plasma and result in distributions of cosmic rays\nwhich deviate from pure power-laws. Such deviations are crucial to acceleration\nefficiency and spectral considerations, producing GeV/TeV intensity ratios that\nare quite different from test particle predictions. The Sedov scaling solution\nfor SNR expansions is used to estimate important shock parameters for input\ninto the Monte Carlo simulation. We calculate ion and electron distributions\nthat spawn neutral pion decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton, and synchrotron\nemission, yielding complete photon spectra from radio frequencies to gamma-ray\nenergies. The cessation of acceleration caused by the spatial and temporal\nlimitations of the expanding SNR shell in moderately dense interstellar regions\ncan yield spectral cutoffs in the TeV energy range; these are consistent with\nWhipple's TeV upper limits on unidentified EGRET sources. Supernova remnants in\nlower density environments generate higher energy cosmic rays that produce\npredominantly inverse Compton emission at super-TeV energies; such sources will\ngenerally be gamma-ray dim at GeV energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 1998 18:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Therefore, each single\nobject experiences its own (local), stochastically chosen Time, which is as\nreal for it, as the macroscopic Time is real in classical physics. Therefore,\ninstead of the \"indeterminism\" with regard to the macroscopic Time, MTI\nproposes \"determinism\", but with regard to the set(s) of (stochastically\nchosen) local Times. Within an axiomatization, which includes the composite\nsystem \"single object+apparatus+environment, MTI leads to : (i) Recognizing the\namplification process as the fundamental \"part\" of the measurement process,\n(ii) Nonvalidity of the Schrodinger equation concerning the \"whole\", O+A+E,\nwhich makes the \"state reduction process\" unnecessary and unphysical, (iii)\nNatural deducibility of the macroscopic irreversibility, and (iv)\nNonequivalence of MTI with any existing measurement theory, or interpretation.\nThus, within MTI, the measurement problem reduces basically onto the search for\nquantum effect, which would allow forthe local, stochastic change of Time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 1998 15:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
