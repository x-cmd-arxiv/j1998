First, we model the radial velocity field and\nphotometry, and, using a Bayesian technique, estimate the triaxiality T and\nshort-to-long axis ratio c in five concentric annuli between approximately 1\nand 3 effective radii. The results are completely consistent with T being\nconstant inside about 2.5 r_e (36 arcsec; 6.7/h kpc). Adding an assumption of\nconstant T as prior information gives an upper limit of T < 0.16 (95%\nconfidence); this relaxes to T < 0.22 if it is also assumed that there is\nperfect alignment between the angular momentum and the galaxy's intrinsic short\naxis. Near axisymmetry permits us then to use axisymmetric models to constrain\nthe radial mass profile. Using the Jeans (moment) equations, we demonstrate\nthat 2-integral, constant-M/L models cannot fit the data; but a 2-integral\nmodel in which the cumulative enclosed M/L increases by a factor of roughly 2\nfrom the center out to 12/h kpc can.

The presented HPD designs are based on\nthree innovations.

(ii) To prevent\npositive ion feedback in HPDs, we introduced a permanent potential barrier in\nfront of the anode. (iii) To replace a transmittive by a reflective\nphotocathode, we arrived at a conceptually new HPD design with surprisingly\ngood imaging characteristics, high quantum efficiency and low cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 1998 18:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Both systems\ncorrespond to ring-shaped potentials. They admit two maximally super-integrable\nsystems as limiting cases, viz, the isotropic harmonic oscillator system and\nthe Coulomb-Kepler system in three dimensions. The planarity of the\ntrajectories is studied in a systematic way. In general, the trajectories are\nquasi-periodic rather than periodic. A constraint condition allows to pass from\nquasi-periodic motions to periodic ones. When written in a quantum mechanical\ncontext, this constraint condition leads to new accidental degeneracies for the\ntwo systems studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 1998 08:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
