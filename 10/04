In this paper, we investigate the fate of the gas\nring, involving self-gravity of gas, using two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We find that the gas ring becomes gravitationally unstable for a\ngas surface density of gas above a critical value, and fragments into several\ngas clumps. Some denser clumps increase their mass via the accretion of the\nsurrounding gas and collisions with other clumps, and finally a very massive\ngas clump (10^7 M_sun) is formed. Due to the torque from the most massive\nclump, a part of the gas in the ring loses its angular momentum and falls into\nthe galactic center. As a result, a nuclear gas disk (50 pc) is formed around\nthe SMBH. The accretion rate for $R<50$ pc attains about 1 M_sun/yr for\n3.5*10^7 yr. At the final phase of the bar-driven fueling, self-gravity is\ncrucial for the angular momentum transfer of the gas. This is a new mechanism\nfor gas fueling to the vicinity of the SMBH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 1998 14:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}
