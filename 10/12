We consider m=1\nperturbations with odd symmetry with respect to the z=0 midplane. Since the\nresponse of a viscous disk is not in phase with the perturbing potential, a\ntidal torque is exerted on the disk, resulting in a decrease of its angular\nmomentum. This tidal torque is found to be comparable to the horizontal viscous\nstress acting on the background flow when the perturbed velocities in the disk\nare on the order of the sound speed. If these velocities remain subsonic, the\ntidal torque can exceed the horizontal viscous stress only if the viscous\nparameter \\alpha which couples to the vertical shear is larger than that\ncoupled to the horizontal shear. In protostellar disks, bending waves are found\nto propagate deep into the disk inner parts. If the waves are reflected at the\ncenter, resonances occur when the frequency of the tidal waves is equal to that\nof some free normal global bending mode of the disk. If such resonances exist,\ntidal interactions may then be important even when the binary separation is\nlarge. Out of resonance, the torque associated with the secular perturbation is\ngenerally much larger than that associated with the finite frequency\nperturbations. As long as the waves are damped before they reach the center,\nthe torque associated with the finite frequency perturbations does not depend\non the viscosity.
