In order to estimate the effect of\nblending on the result of lensing experiments, it is, therefore, essential to\nknow how the observed lensing parameters change depending on the fraction of\nblended light. Previously, the changed lensing parameters were obtained with a\nstatistical method that not only required a large amount of computation time\nbut also was prone to uncertainty. In this paper, we derive analytic relations\nbetween the lensing parameters with and without the effect of blending.

In this work we\nintroduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if there is no reason to\nprefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be\n`weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique\ninner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the\nprinciple of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product.\nArmed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an\nearlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient\nreason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical\nprobabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of\namplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time\nevolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on\nthe conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct\nentropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution\nhas been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables\nand we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information\ntheory. Finally, we discuss how various connections among the postulates of\nquantum theory are made explicit within this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 1998 20:23:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 1999 20:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
