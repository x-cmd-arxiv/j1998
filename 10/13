An example of great interest is the skewness $S_3$ of\nthe galaxy distribution, defined as the ratio of the third moment $\\xibar_3$\nand the variance squared $\\xibar_2^2$. Suppose one is given unbiased estimators\nfor $\\xibar_3$ and $\\xibar_2^2$ respectively, taking a ratio of the two does\nnot necessarily result in an unbiased estimator of $S_3$. Exactly such an\nestimation-bias affects most existing measurements of $S_3$.

We present a re-analysis of some existing\nmeasurements of the variance and skewness and show that most of the well-known\nsystematic discrepancies between surveys with similar selection criteria, but\ndifferent sizes, can be attributed to the volume-dependent estimation-biases.\nThis affects the inference of the galaxy-bias(es) from these surveys. Our\nmethodology can be adapted to measurements of analogous quantities in quasar\nspectra and weak-lensing maps. We suggest methods to reduce the above\nestimation-biases, and point out other examples in LSS studies which might\nsuffer from the same type of a nonlinear-estimation-bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 1998 02:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In many subjects, most\nnotably in Taxonomy such tree structures have been studied using ultrametrics.\nHere syntactical hierarchical phrase trees are subject to a similar analysis,\nwhich is much siompler as the branching structure is more readily discernible\nand switched. The occurence of hierarchical structure elsewhere in linguistics\nis mentioned. The phrase tree can be represented by a matrix and the elements\nof the matrix can be represented by triangles. The height at which branching\noccurs is not prescribed in previous syntatic models, but it is by using the\nultrametric matrix. The ambiguity of which branching height to choose is\nresolved by postulating that branching occurs at the lowest height available.\nAn ultrametric produces a measure of the complexity of sentences: presumably\nthe complexity of sentence increases as a language is aquired so that this can\nbe tested. A All ultrametric triangles are equilateral or isocles, here it is\nshown that X structur implies that there are no equilateral triangles.\nRestricting attention to simple syntax a minium ultrametric distance between\nlexical categories is calculatex. This ultrametric distance is shown to be\ndifferent than the matrix obtasined from feaures. It is shown that the\ndefinition of c-commabnd can be replaced by an equivalent ultrametric\ndefinition.
