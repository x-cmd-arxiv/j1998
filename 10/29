We show that if this\ndoes occur, then there are two possibilities for the resulting neutron-star\nevolution:\n  If the r-mode damping is a decreasing function of temperature, then the star\nundergoes a cyclic evolution: (i) accretional spin-up triggers the instability\nnear the observed maximum spin rate; (ii) the r-modes become highly excited\nthrough gravitational-radiation reaction, and in a fraction of a year they\nviscously heat the star; (iii) r-mode gravitational-radiation reaction then\nspins the star down in a fraction of a year to some limiting rotational\nfrequency; (iv) the r-mode instability shuts off; (v) the neutron star slowly\ncools and is spun up by accretion, until it once again reaches the instability\npoint, closing the cycle. The shortness of the epoch of r-mode activity makes\nit unlikely that r-modes are currently excited in the neutron star of any\ngalactic LMXBs. Nevertheless, this cyclic evolution could be responsible for\nkeeping the rotational frequencies within the observed LMXB frequency range.\n  If, on the other hand, the r-mode damping is temperature independent, then a\nsteady state with constant angular velocity and $T_{\\rm core}\\simeq 4\\times\n10^8$K is reached, in which r-mode viscous heating is balanced by neutrino\ncooling and accretional spin-up torque is balanced by\ngravitational-radiation-reaction spin-down torque.
