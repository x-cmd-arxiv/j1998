We present an algorithm that establishes a\ntight bound within this minimal amount of search, and show that any other\nalgorithm would have to search strictly more. The fraction of nodes needed to\nbe searched approaches zero as the number of agents grows. If additional time\nremains, our anytime algorithm searches further, and establishes a\nprogressively lower tight bound. Surprisingly, just searching one more node\ndrops the bound in half. As desired, our algorithm lowers the bound rapidly\nearly on, and exhibits diminishing returns to computation. It also drastically\noutperforms its obvious contenders. Finally, we show how to distribute the\ndesired search across self-interested manipulative agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 1998 16:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This is the\nsimplest example of a host of diverse one-time-physics systems with hidden\nSO(d,2) symmetric actions. By the addition of gauge degrees of freedom, they\ncan all be lifted to the same SO(d,2) covariant unified theory that includes an\nextra spacelike and an extra timelike dimension. The resulting action in d+2\ndimensions has manifest SO(d,2) Lorentz symmetry and a gauge symmetry Sp(2,R)\nand it defines two-time-physics. Conversely, the two-time action can be gauge\nfixed to diverse one-time physical systems. In this paper three new gauge fixed\nforms that correspond to the non-relativistic particle, the massive\nrelativistic particle, and the particle in AdS_(d-n) x S^n spacetime will be\ndiscussed. The last case is discussed at the first quantized and field theory\nlevels as well. For the last case the popularly known symmetry is SO(d-n-1,2) x\nSO(n+1), but yet we show that it is symmetric under the larger SO(d,2). In the\nfield theory version the action is symmetric under the full SO(d,2) provided it\nis improved with a quantized mass term that arises as an anomaly from operator\nordering ambiguities. The anomalous cosmological term vanishes for AdS_2 x S^0\nand AdS_n x S^n (i.e. d=2n). The strikingly larger symmetry could be\nsignificant in the context of the proposed AdS/CFT duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 1998 23:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 1998 04:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}
