This model is obtained by using perturbation theory to trace out the\nconduction electrons degrees of freedom in conventional superconducting alloys.\nThe model is formulated in the path integral formalism where the spin operators\nare represented by bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields and it reduces to\na single site problem that can be solved within the static approximation with a\nreplica symmetric Ansatz. We argue that this is a valid procedure for values of\ntemperature above the de Almeida-Thouless instability line. The phase diagram\nin the T-g plane, where g is the strength of the pairing interaction, for fixed\nvariance J^2/N of the random couplings J_{ij}, exhibits three regions: a normal\nparamagnetic (NP) phase, a spin glass (SG) phase and a pairing (PAIR) phase\nwhere there is formation of local pairs.The NP and PAIR phases are separated by\na second order transition line g=g_{c}(T) that ends at a tricritical point\nT_{3}=0.9807J, g_{3}=5,8843J, from where it becomes a first order transition\nline that meets the line of second order transitions at T_{c}=0.9570J that\nseparates the NP and the SG phases. For T<T_{c} the SG phase is separated from\nthe PAIR phase by a line of first order transitions.\n  These results agree qualitatively with experimental data in\nGd_{x}Th_{1-x}RU_{2}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 1998 14:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Penrose has suggested a mechanism for objective reduction of\nquantum states with postulated collapse time T = h/E, where E is an\nill-definedness in the gravitational self-energy stemming from the profound\nconflict between the principles of superposition and general covariance. Here\nit is argued that, even if Penrose's overall conceptual scheme for the\nbreakdown of quantum mechanics is unreservedly accepted, his formula for the\ncollapse time of superpositions reduces to T --> oo (E --> 0) in the strictly\nNewtonian regime, which is the domain of his proposed experiment to corroborate\nthe effect. A suggestion is made to rectify this situation. In particular,\nrecognising the cogency of Penrose's reasoning in the domain of full `quantum\ngravity', it is demonstrated that an appropriate experiment which could in\nprinciple corroborate his argued `macroscopic' breakdown of superpositions is\nnot the one involving non-rotating mass distributions as he has suggested, but\na Leggett-type SQUID or BEC experiment involving superposed mass distributions\nin relative rotation. The demonstration thereby brings out one of the\ndistinctive characteristics of Penrose's scheme, rendering it empirically\ndistinguishable from other state reduction theories involving gravity. As an\naside, a new geometrical measure of gravity-induced deviation from quantum\nmechanics in the manner of Penrose is proposed, but now for the canonical\ncommutation relations [Q, P] = ih.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 1998 21:14:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 1998 14:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 1999 16:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

Both experimental and\ntheoretical approaches seem to say that there is a natural frequency range\nassociated with intermolecular motions in liquids, typically spanning no more\nthan a few hundred cm^{-1}. Landau-Teller-like theories explain how a solvent\ncan absorb any vibrational energy within this \"band\", but how is it that\nmolecules can rid themselves of superfluous vibrational energies significantly\nin excess of these values? We develop a theory for such processes based on the\nidea that the crucial liquid motions are those that most rapidly modulate the\nforce on the vibrating coordinate -- and that by far the most important of\nthese motions are those involving what we have called the mutual nearest\nneighbors of the vibrating solute. Specifically, we suggest that whenever there\nis a single solvent molecule sufficiently close to the solute that the solvent\nand solute are each other's nearest neighbors, then the instantaneous\nscattering dynamics of the solute-solvent pair alone suffices to explain the\nhigh frequency relaxation. The many-body features of the liquid only appear in\nthe guise of a purely equilibrium problem, that of finding the likelihood of\nparticularly effective solvent arrangements around the solute.

Phys. Lett. A 12 (1997) 2919; astro-ph/9806280)\nthe discovery of A New Redshift Interpretation (NRI) of the Hubble relation and\nthe 2.7K CBR, which showed for the first time that it was possible to explain\nthese phenomena within the framework of a universe governed by Einstein's\nstatic-spacetime general relativity (GR) instead of the Friedmann-Lemaitre\nexpanding-spacetime paradigm. More recently Carlip and Scranton\n(astro-ph/9808021; C&S) claim to find flaws in this discovery, while also\nclaiming the standard cosmology is error free. Their analysis assumes the NRI\nrepresents a static cosmological model of the universe. This is wrong. My MPLA\nreport clearly states the NRI encompasses an expanding universe wherein\ngalaxies are undergoing Doppler recession due to vacuum density repulsion.\nC&S's confusion on this crucial point leads to serious errors in their\nanalysis. Next, in claiming the standard cosmology is error free, C&S fail to\nrespond to the contradictory evidence in my preprint, gr-qc/9806061. There I\nfirst show why the universe is governed by Einstein static-spacetime GR, and\nnot the Friedmann-Lemaitre expanding spacetime paradigm on which Big Bang\ncosmology is critically hinged. Secondly, I note a most embarrassing fact about\nthe F-L paradigm--namely, that it has always involved gargantuan\nnonconservation-of-energy losses amounting to the mass equivalent of about\nthirty million universes, each with a mass of 10^21 suns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 1998 21:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
