This mass-density relation is well\ndescribed by a proportionality between the characteristic density of halos and\nthe mean cosmic density at halo formation time. It has recently been shown that\nthis proportionality could be the result of the following simple evolutionary\npicture. Halos form in major mergers with essentially the same,\ncosmogony-dependent, dimensionless profile, and then grow inside-outside, as a\nconsequence of accretion. Here we verify the consistency of this picture and\nshow that it predicts the correct zero point of the mass-density relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 1998 19:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The aim is to determine the relation between QSOs and galaxies as\na function of redshift. We cross-correlate a sample of ~150 QSOs from optically\nand X-ray selected catalogues with faint, bj<23, galaxies. These data allow us\nto probe the galaxy clustering environment of QSOs out to z~1.0-1.5. Far from\ngiving a positive correlation, at z<1.5 the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation\nfunction is marginally negative, with w(theta<120'')=-0.027+-0.020. Colour\ninformation suggests that the anti-correlation is most significant between the\nQSOs and the red galaxy population.\n  We have constructed models to predict the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation, using\nthe known form of the galaxy N(z) at bj<23, and assuming a variety of\nclustering evolution rates. Cases in which QSOs exist in rich cluster\nenvironments are comfortably ruled out at more than 5sigma and the results are\nmore consistent with a `normal' galaxy environment for radio-quiet QSOs. If the\nsmall anti-correlation is interpreted as an effect of gravitational lensing,\nthis conclusion is not altered. In this case, the data are only ~1sigma below\nthe low clustering amplitude models, while the high amplitude models are still\ncomfortably rejected. We therefore conclude that these QSOs may not be much\nmore highly biased than optically selected galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 1998 15:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
