If Sgr is\nsymmetric, this implies a true major-axis diameter of at least 68 degrees, or\nnearly 30 kpc if all portions of Sgr are equally distant from the Sun.

Systematic incompleteness will therefore affect the\nnew generation of large quasar surveys that select by $U-B \\le -0.35$. By\ncorrecting for this incompleteness, we find, from the first data set ($B <\n21.0$ and $z < 2.2$), that the evolution of the quasar luminosity function (LF)\nis best described by joint luminosity and density evolution.

Thus the dynamical interactions enforce near\nuniform horizontal velocity inside the convection zone. They also give rise to\na narrow shear layer in the region of convective overshoot at the top of the\nradiative interior. Turbulent damping inside the convection zone is negligible\nfor all modes, but that in the region of convective overshoot may be\nsignificant for a few long period modes near the red edge of the instability\nstrip.
