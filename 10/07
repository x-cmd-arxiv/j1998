The evolution is shown to proceed in three different stages.\nAt first stage, pressure and density set in the equilibrium equation of state,\nand velocity profile steepens gradually as in case of pressure-free flows. At\nsecond stage, those regions of the flow where anomalous pressure (i.e. with\nnegative compressibility) holds, create velocity profile more sharp than in\npressure-free case, which in turn results in formation of a very narrow\n(short-wavelength) region where gas separates the equilibrium equation of state\nand pressure equilibrium sets in rapidly. On this stage, variation in pressure\nbetween narrow dense region and extended environment does not exceed more than\n0.01 of the unperturbed value. On third stage, gas in the short-wavelength\nregion reaches the second (high-density) stable state, and pressure balance\nestablishes through the flow with pressure equal to the one in the unperturbed\nstate.

The model has\ntwo components : (1) our key assumption is that a crash may be caused by local\nself-reinforcing imitation between noise traders. If the tendency for noise\ntraders to imitate their nearest neighbors increases up to a certain point\ncalled the ``critical'' point, all noise traders may place the same order\n(sell) at the same time, thus causing a crash. The interplay between the\nprogressive strengthening of imitation and the ubiquity of noise is\ncharacterized by the hazard rate, i.e. the probability per unit time that the\ncrash will happen in the next instant if it has not happened yet. (2) Since the\ncrash is not a certain deterministic outcome of the bubble, it remains rational\nfor traders to remain invested provided they are compensated by a higher rate\nof growth of the bubble for taking the risk of a crash. Our model distinguishes\nbetween the end of the bubble and the time of the crash,: the rational\nexpectation constraint has the specific implication that the date of the crash\nmust be random. The theoretical death of the bubble is not the time of the\ncrash because the crash could happen at any time before, even though this is\nnot very likely. The death of the bubble is the most probable time for the\ncrash. There also exists a finite probability of attaining the end of the\nbubble without crash. Our model has specific predictions about the presence of\ncertain critical log-periodic patterns in pre-crash prices, associated with the\ndeterministic components of the bubble mechanism.

The general\nformulae about the fixed points and their stability as well as the squeezing\nspectra calculated linearizing around such points are given. The use of a\nnonlinear normalization allows to disentangle in the spectra the dynamic\nresponse of the system from the contributions of the various noisy inputs. A\ngeneral ``reference'' model for one-mode systems is developed in which the\ndynamic aspects of the problem are not contaminated by static contributions\nfrom the noisy inputs. The physical insight gained permits the elaboration of\ngeneral criteria to optimize the noise suppression performance. With respect to\nthe squeezing in the fundamental mode the optimum working point is located near\nthe first turning point of the dispersive bistability induced by cascading of\nthe second order nonlinear response. The nonlinearities induced by conventional\ncrystals appear enough to reach it being the squeezing ultimately limited by\nthe escape efficiency of the cavity. In the case of the harmonic mode both,\nfinite phase mismatch and/or harmonic mode driving allow for an optimum dynamic\nresponse of the system something not possible in the standard phase matched\nSecond Harmonic Generation. The squeezing is then limited by the losses in the\nharmonic mode, allowing for very high degrees of squeezing because of the\nnon-resonant nature of the mode. This opens the possibility of very high\nperformances using artificial materials with resonantly enhanced\nnonlinearities. It is also shown how it is possible to substantially increase\nthe noise reduction and at the same time to more than double the output power\nfor parameters corresponding to reported experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 1998 11:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
