Data from our long-term scintillation study of 18 pulsars in the DM\nrange 3-35 pc cm^{-3} (Paper I) are used to investigate two important\nobservable effects of refractive scintillation: (i) modulations of DISS\nobservables and flux, and (ii) drifting bands. Our data provide simultaneous\nmeasurements of decorrelation bandwidth, scintillation time scale, flux density\nand drift slope of patterns. The observed modulations of the first 3 are\ncompared with the theoretical predictions, and constraints are placed on the\ndensity spectral form. The measured modulation indices are larger than\npredicted by a Kolmogorov form. Measurements of drift slopes and DISS\nparameters are used to independently estimate the slope of the density\nspectrum, which is found to be consistent with a Kolmogorov form for several\npulsars.The contradictory results from these 2 independent methods are not\nreconcilable with the simple theoretical models. Our observations show\nanomalous behaviour like persistent drifting bands for some pulsars.This can be\ninterpreted as an excess power in the low wavenumber range (~10^{-12} -\n10^{-13} m^{-1}) compared to the Kolmogorov expectations or the existence of\nlocalized density structures.The results from our observations and those from\nthe earlier studies are examined for understanding the overall nature of the\ndensity spectrum.The emerging picture is a Kolmogorov-like form in the\nwavenumber range ~10^{-6} m^{-1} to ~10^{-11} m^{-1}, which either steepens or\nhas a bump near ~ 10^{-12} - 10^{-13} m^{-1}.

Though there is substantial observational data to support\nseveral consequences of it, the quantitative predictions from theories have not\nbeen thoroughly tested. In this paper, data from our long-term scintillation\nstudy of 18 pulsars are used to test the predictions. The fluctuations of\ndecorrelation bandwidth ($\\nu_d$), scintillation time scale ($\\tau_d$) and flux\ndensity (F) are examined for their cross-correlations and compared with the\npredictions. The theory predicts a strong correlation between $\\nu_d$ and\n$\\tau_d$, and strong anti-correlations between $\\nu_d$ and F, and $\\tau_d$ and\nF. For 5 pulsars, we see a reasonable agreement. There is considerable\ndifficulty in reconciling the results for the rest of the pulsars. Our analysis\nshows the underlying noise sources can sometimes reduce the correlation, but\ncannot cause an absence of correlation. It is also unlikely that the poor flux\ncorrelations arise from a hitherto unrecognized intrinsic flux variations. For\nPSR B0834+06, which shows anomalous behaviour of persistent drift slopes,\npositive correlation is found between $\\tau_d$ and the drift-corrected $\\nu_d$.\nMany pulsars show an anti-correlation between $\\nu_d$ and the drift slope, and\nthis is in accordance with the simple models of RISS. The detections of\ncorrelated variations of observables and a reasonable agreement between the\npredicted and measured correlations for some pulsars confirm RISS as the\nprimary cause of the observed fluctuations. However, the complexity seen with\nthe detailed results suggests the necessity of more comprehensive theoretical\ntreatments for describing refractive fluctuations and their correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 1998 19:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Keck Telescope. Our principal goal is to investigate\nthe abundance patterns of the damped systems and thereby determine the\nunderlying physical processes which dominate their chemical evolution. We place\nparticular emphasis on gauging the relative importance of two complementary\neffects often invoked to explain the damped lya abundances: (1) nucleosynthetic\nenrichment from Type II supernovae and (2) an ISM-like dust depletion pattern.\n  Similar to the principal results of Lu et al. (1996), our observations lend\nsupport both for dust depletion and Type II SN enrichment. Specifically, the\nobserved overabundance of Zn/Fe and underabundance of Ni/Fe relative to solar\nabundances suggest significant dust depletion within the damped lya systems.\nMeanwhile, the relative abundances of Al, Si, and Cr vs. Fe are consistent with\nboth dust depletion and Type II supernova enrichment. Our measurements of Ti/Fe\nand the Mn/Fe measurements from Lu et al. (1996), however, cannot be explained\nby dust depletion and indicate an underlying Type II SN pattern. Finally, the\nobserved values of [S/Fe] are inconsistent with the combined effects of dust\ndepletion and the nucleosynthetic yields expected for Type II supernovae. This\nlast result emphasizes the need for another physical process to explain the\ndamped lya abundance patterns.\n  We also examine the metallicity of the damped lya systems both with respect\nto Zn/H and Fe/H. Our results confirm previous surveys by Pettini and\ncollaborators, i.e., [<Zn/H>] = -1.15 +/- 0.15 dex.

These solitons are somewhat distinct from those\nof pure $CP^1$ model as they cannot always be characterised by $\\pi_2(CP^1)=Z$.\nIn this paper, we first carry out a detailed Hamiltonian analysis of this\ngauged $CP^1$ model.

The $U(1)$ gauge invariance of the\noriginal (ungauged) $CP^1$ model is actually contained in the $SU(2)$ group\nitself. Then we couple the Hopf term associated to these solitons and again\ncarry out its Hamiltonian analysis. The symplectic structures, along with the\nstructures of the constraints of these two models (with or without Hopf term)\nare found to be essentially the same. The model with a Hopf term is shown to\nhave fractional spin which, when computed in the radiation gauge, is found to\ndepend not only on the soliton number $N$, but also on the nonabelian charge.\nWe then carry out a reduced (partially) phase space analysis in a different\nphysical sector of the model where the degrees of freedom associated with the\n$CP^1$ fields are transformed away. The model now reduces to a $U(1)$ gauge\ntheory with two Chern-Simons gauge fields getting mass-like terms and one\nremaining massless.
