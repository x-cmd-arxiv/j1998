Real turbulent flows exhibit the\neffects of anisotropic forcing. The analysis of correlation functions and\nstructure functions in isotropic and anisotropic situations is facilitated and\nmade rational when performed in terms of the irreducible representations of the\nrelevant symmetry group which is the group of all rotations SO(3). In this\npaper we firstly consider the needed general theory and explain why we expect\ndifferent (universal) scaling exponents in the different sectors of the\nsymmetry group. We exemplify the theory context of isotropic turbulence (for\nthird order tensorial structure functions) and in weakly anisotropic turbulence\n(for the second order structure function). The utility of the resulting\nexpressions for the analysis of experimental data is demonstrated in the\ncontext of high Reynolds number measurements of turbulence in the atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 1998 12:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Then photon-photon physics at various gamma-gamma-invariant\nmass scales is discussed. The region of several GeV, relevant for RHIC is\ndominated by QCD phenomena (meson and vector meson pair production). Invariant\nmasses of up to about 100 GeV can be reached at LHC, and the potential for new\nphysics is discussed. Photonuclear reactions and other important background\neffects, especially diffractive processes are also discussed. Lepton-pair\nproduction, especially electron-positron pair production is copious.

There are instances when the\ncurrent widely used theory yields results having no physical meaning. As a\nresult, the current widely used theory is not equipped to cope with some of the\nmost fundamental problems in physics. In the present investigation, a new\nformulation is proposed based on certain non-Maxwellian quantities which occur\nwhenever there is absorption. In the proposed formulation, the inconsistencies\nand contradictions disclosed by the Ginzburg Paradox have been removed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 1998 11:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
