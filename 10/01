The key\nassumption of the method is that cosmic structure formed by gravitational\ninstability from Gaussian primordial fluctuations. For a specified value of\n\\Omega_0, matching the observed cluster mass function then fixes the value of\n\\sigma_8, the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in 8\\hmpc spheres, and it thus\ndetermines the normalization of P(k) at z=0. The value of \\Omega_0 also\ndetermines the ratio of P(k) at z=0 to P(k) at z=2.5, the central redshift of\nthe \\lya forest data; the ratio is different for an open universe (\\Lambda=0)\nor a flat universe. Because the \\lya forest measurement only reaches comoving\nscales 2\\pi/k ~ 15-20\\hmpc, the derived value of \\Omega_0 depends on the value\nof the power spectrum shape parameter \\Gamma, which determines the relative\ncontribution of larger scale modes to \\sigma_8. Adopting \\Gamma=0.2, a value\nfavored by galaxy clustering data, we find \\Omega_0 = 0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.10} for\nan open universe and \\Omega_0=0.34^{+0.13}_{-0.09} for a flat universe (1\\sigma\nerrors, not including the uncertainty in cluster normalization).\nCluster-normalized models with \\Omega_0=1 predict too low an amplitude for P(k)\nat z=2.5, while models with \\Omega_0=0.1 predict too high an amplitude. The\nmore general best fit parameter combination is approximately \\Omega_0 +\n0.2\\Lambda_0 = 0.46 + 1.3(\\Gamma-0.2). Analysis of larger, existing samples of\nQSO spectra could greatly improve the measurement of P(k) from the \\lya forest,\nallowing a determination of \\Omega_0 by this method with a precision of ~15%,\nlimited mainly by uncertainty in the cluster mass function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 1998 13:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Moreover, mixtures of grains of different\nsizes spontaneously segregate in the absence of external perturbations: when a\nmixture is simply poured onto a pile, the large grains are more likely to be\nfound near the base, while the small grains are more likely to be near the top.\nHere, we report a spontaneous phenomenon arising when we pour a mixture between\ntwo vertical plates: the mixture spontaneously stratifies into alternating\nlayers of small and large grains whenever the large grains are rougher than the\nsmall grains. In contrast, we find only spontaneous segregation when the large\ngrains are more rounded than the small grains. The stratification is related to\nthe occurrence of avalanches; during each avalanche the grains comprising the\navalanche spontaneously stratify into a pair of layers through a \"kink\"\nmechanism, with the small grains forming a sublayer underneath the layer of\nlarge grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 1998 21:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

The\nmode-coupling calculation, for Farley-Buneman turbulence, is developed in order\nto place it in perspective and to estimate its magnitude relative to the\nanomalous effects which arise through the nonlinear wave-particle interaction.\nThis nonlinear effect, known as nonlinear ``Landau damping'' is due to the\ncoupling of waves which produces other waves which in turn lose energy to the\nbulk of the particles by Landau damping. This leads to a decay of the wave\nenergy and consequently a heating of the plasma. An equation governing the\nevolution of the field spectrum is derived and a physical interpration for each\nof its terms is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 1998 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

As illustrated\nin Fig. 1, in the implementation of this procedure, by Bouwmeester et al., an\ninput quantum state is `disembodied' into quantum and classical components, as\nin the original protocol. However, in contrast to the original scheme,\nBouwmeester et al.'s procedure necessarily destroys the state at Bob's\nreceiving terminal, so a `teleported' state can never emerge as a freely\npropagating state for subsequent examination or exploitation. In fact,\nteleportation is achieved only as a postdiction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 1998 11:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
