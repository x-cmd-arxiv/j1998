As an alternative, we construct a\nphysically motivated model for the adiabatic collapse of pre-heated gas into an\nisothermal potential that improves upon the original work of Kaiser (1991). The\nluminosity and temperature of the gas is calculated, assuming an appropriate\ndistribution of halo formation times and radiation due to both bremsstrahlung\nand recombination processes. This model successfully reproduces the slope and\ndispersion of the luminosity-temperature relation of galaxy groups. We also\npresent calculations of the temperature and luminosity functions for galaxy\ngroups under the prescription of this model. This model makes two strong\npredictions for haloes with total masses M<10^13 M_sun, which are not yet\ntestable with current data: (1) the gas mass fraction will increase in direct\nproportion to the halo mass; (2) the gas temperature will be larger than the\nvirial temperature of the mass. The second effect is strong enough that group\nmasses determined from gas temperatures will be overestimated by about an order\nof magnitude if it is assumed that the gas temperature is the virial\ntemperature. The entropy required to match observations can be obtained by\nheating the gas at the turnaround time, for example, to about 3 X 10^6 K at\nz=1, which is too high to be generated by a normal rate of supernova\nexplosions. This model breaks down on the scale of low mass clusters, but this\nis an acceptable limitation, as we expect accretion shocks to contribute\nsignificantly to the entropy of the gas in such objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 1998 19:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 1999 17:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The galaxies are drawn from fifteen Abell clusters that lie in the\nredshift range 9000-12,000 km/sec and are distributed uniformly around the\ncelestial sky. The data set consists of R-band CCD photometry and long- slit\nH-alpha spectroscopy. The rotation curves (RCs) are characterized by a turnover\nradius (r_t) and an asymptotic velocity v_a, while the surface brightness\nprofiles are characterized in terms of an effective exponential surface\nbrightness I_e and a scale length r_e. The TF scatter is minimized when the\nrotation velocity is measured at 2.0 +/- 0.2 r_e; a significantly larger\nscatter results when the rotation velocity is measured at > 3 or < 1.5 scale\nlengths. This effect demonstrates that RCs do not have a universal form, as has\nbeen suggested by Persic, Salucci, and Stel. In contrast to previous studies, a\nmodest but statistically significant surface-brightness dependence of the TF\nrelation is found, log v = const + 0.28*log L + 0.14*log I_e. This indicates a\nstronger parallel between the TF relation and the FP relations of elliptical\ngalaxies than has previously been recognized.

The squeezed atom state is a collective atomic\nstate whose quantum fluctuations in population difference or collective dipole\nare smaller than those of the coherent atom state. It is shown that the\nsqueezed atom state can be generated by the interaction of atoms with a\ncoherent state of the electromagnetic field, and that it can be used as a\ntunable source of squeezed radiation. A variety of squeezed states, including\nthe photon-number squeezed state and the phase squeezed state, can be produced\nby manipulating the atomic state. This is owing to the fact that\nquantum-statistical information of the atomic state is faithfully transferred\nto that of the photon state. Possible experimental situations to implement our\ntheory are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 1998 12:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 1998 10:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 1999 09:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 1999 09:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
