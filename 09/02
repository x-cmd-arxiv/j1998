In the limit of weak\ncoupling, the system is adequately described within the sequential tunneling\napproximation. At low temperatures, however, the system crosses over to a\nstrong coupling phase, which we analyze using renormalization group techniques.\nWe find that at low temperatures a \"perfect\" can be achieved by tuning two\nparameters. This resonance has a peak conductance $G = e^2/2h$ and is a\nrealization of the weak backscattering limit of the $g=1/2$ Luttinger liquid,\nas well as the non Fermi liquid fixed point of the two channel Kondo problem.\nWe discuss several regimes which may be experimentally accessible as well as\nthe implications for resonances recently observed in cleaved edge overgrowth\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 1998 16:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Results obtained in previous works (in the case D=4 and $V(x) =\\xi R(x)\n+ m^2$) are rigorously proven and generalized. It is also proven that, in\nstatic Euclidean manifolds, the method is compatible with Lorentzian-time\nanalytic continuations. It is found that, for $D>1$, the result of the $\\zeta$\nfunction procedure is the same obtained from an improved version of the\npoint-splitting method which uses a particular choice of the term $w_0(x,y)$ in\nthe Hadamard expansion of the Green function. This point-splitting procedure\nworks for any value of the field mass $m$. Furthermore, in the case D=4 and\n$V(x) = \\xi R(x)+ m^2$, the given procedure generalizes the Euclidean version\nof Wald's improved point-splitting procedure. The found point-splitting method\nshould work generally, also dropping the hypothesis of a closed manifold, and\nnot depending on the $\\zeta$-function procedure. This fact is checked in the\nEuclidean section of Minkowski spacetime for $A = -\\Delta + m^2$ where the\nmethod gives rise to the correct stress tensor for $m^2 \\geq 0$ automatically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 1998 16:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 1998 17:12:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 1999 08:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

For M-theory compactified on a Joyce manifold $M^7$, the fact\nthat $M^7$ is constructed via a generalized Kummer construction on a 7-torus\n${\\smallBbb T}^7$ with a torsion-free $G_2$-structure $\\phi$ suggests that\nthere are natural fibrations of $M^7$ by ${\\smallBbb T}^3$, ${\\smallBbb T}^4$,\nand K3 surfaces in a way governed by $\\phi$.
