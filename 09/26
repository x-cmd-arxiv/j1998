We demonstrate that the presence of coherent\npulsations from a weakly magnetic neutron star over a wide range of accretion\nrates places strong constraints on models of the disk-magnetosphere\ninteraction.

Since the gas mass fraction from the hot ICM is believed to be\nconstant in time, the value of the cosmological deceleration parameter $q_0$\ncan be determined by comparing the calculated gas mass fraction in nearby and\ndistant clusters (Pen 1997). To test the potential of this method, we compare\nthe gas fractions derived for a sample of luminous ($L_X > 10^{45} $erg\ns$^{-1}$), nearby clusters with those calculated for eight luminous, distant\n($0.3 < z < 0.6$) clusters using ASCA and ROSAT observations. For consistency,\nwe evaluate the gas mass fraction at a fixed physical radius of 1 $h_{50}^{-1}$\nMpc (assuming $q_0=0.0$). We find a best fit value of $q_0 = 0.07$ with -0.47 <\nq_0 < 0.67 at 95% confidence. We also determine the gas fraction using the\nmethod of Evrard, Metzler, & Navarro (1997) to find the total mass within\n$r_{500}$, the radius where the mean overdensity of matter is 500 times the\ncritical density. In simulations, this method reduces the scatter in the\ndetermination of gravitational mass without biasing the mean. We find that it\nalso reduces the scatter in actual observations for nearby clusters, but not as\nmuch as simulations suggest. Using this method, the best fit value is $q_0 =\n0.04$ with -0.50 < q_0 < 0.64. The excellent agreement between these two\nmethods suggests that this may be a useful technique for determining $q_0$. The\nconstraints on $q_0$ should improve as more distant clusters are studied and\nprecise temperature profiles are measured to large radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 1998 19:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

These calculations have been\nperformed by shell model diagonalization in the pf shell using the KB3\ninteraction. The Gamow-Teller distributions are used to calculate the electron\ncapture rates for typical presupernova conditions. Our 55Co rate is noticeably\nsmaller than the presently adopted rate as it is dominated by weak low-lying\ntransitions rather than the strong Gamow-Teller (GT) resonance which is located\nat a higher excitation energy in the daughter than usually parametrized.\nAlthough our 56Ni rate agrees with the presently adopted rate, we do not\nconfirm the conventional parametrization of the GT centroid. Our results\nsupport general trends suggested on the basis of shell model Monte Carlo\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 1998 22:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
