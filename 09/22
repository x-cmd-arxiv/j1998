The question of the ``universality class'' of the LCS\nproblem is also considered. For the Bernoulli Matching model we find very good\nagreement with recent scaling predictions of Hwa and Lassig for\nNeedleman-Wunsch sequence alignment.

When phase separation dominates at V=0, the Coulomb\ninteraction breaks the large domains of the two competing phases into small\n``islands'' of one phase embedded into the other.

Shell effects are observed in $\\Delta$ for\nnuclei with Z=28 or N=28 and in the behavior of $A/a$ as a function of the\nnumber of neutrons. We find a significant parity-dependence of the level\ndensities for nuclei with $A \\alt 60$, which diminishes as $A$ increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 1998 08:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Quantile motion is a general description of the\ntransport properties of measurable conserved quantities in quantum mechanics as\nwell as in classical electrodynamics. In the latter case we consider the\nquantile motion of electromagnetic energy as the direct result of a physical\nmeasurement. In this sense the quantile velocity corresponds to the\nelectromagnetic signal velocity also in the presence of barriers and\ninhomogeneities in the medium of propagation. We show that this signal velocity\nis always smaller than the speed of light in vacuum.
