In this\npaper, we show how the Liouville equation can be extended to systems where the\nnumber of particles can vary, such as in open systems or in systems where\nparticles can be annihilated or created. A general conservation equation for an\narbitrary dynamical variable is derived from the extended Liouville equation\nfollowing Irving and Kirkwood's2 technique. From the general conservation\nequation, the particle number conservation equation is obtained that includes\ngeneral terms for the annihilation or creation of particles. It is also shown\nthat the grand canonical ensemble distribution function is a particular\nstationary solution of the extended Liouville equation, as required. In\ngeneral, the extended Liouville equation can be used to study nonequilibrium\nsystems where the total number of particles can vary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 1998 18:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 1998 15:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It reflects the existence of the cross-power\nflow and for any pair of modes which are rigidly linked to each other by this\nrelation. The quasi-orthogonality relation remains true in the limiting case of\nlossless waveguides yielding the customary relations of orthogonality and\nnormalization for propagating (active) modes and also their generalization for\nnonpropagating (reactive) modes. It is shown that the eigenmode set for a\nwaveguiding structure is complete only outside the region of exciting sources.\nInside this region the modal expansions of fields are incomplete and must be\nsupplemented with the orthogonal complementary fields which extend the proper\nHilbert space spanned by waveguide eigenfunctions. Among exciting sources there\nare the external bulk sources (currents, fields, and medium perturbations) and\nthe external surface currents. Besides, the orthogonal complementary fields\ngenerate the effective surface currents on boundaries of the bulk exciting\nsources. The problem of waveguide excitation by external sources is solved by\nmeans of determining both the mode amplitudes for the modal field expansions\nand the orthogonal complementary fields inside the source region. The equations\nof mode excitation are derived on the basis of three approaches applying the\ndirect use of Maxwell's equations, the electrodynamic analogy with the\nmathematical method of variation of constants, and the conjugate reciprocity\ntheorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 1998 21:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At\nthe Plank scale, there exists a quantized, absolute 3D space and separate\n(quantized) time which is not affected by motion or gravity. Light is the\nsimple shifting of a photon information pattern from cell to adjacent cell at\nevery CA 'clock cycle'. The Lorentz transformation is derived from our simple\nmodel of light motion. Inertial mass is revised to acknowledge the absolute\nnature of mass and acceleration. The same electromagnetic quantum vacuum forces\nare also present in masses inside a gravitational field, where now the quantum\nvacuum is accelerated with respect to the mass by graviton exchanges. This\nprocess is responsible for the equivalence principle (WEP), which is derived in\ndetail. Gravity is found to be based on two boson force exchange particles: the\ngraviton and the photon, and both particles are postulated to be almost\nidentical in physical characteristics. 4D space-time curvature is found to\nresult from a 'Fizeau-like' scattering process, where the accelerated\n(electrically charged) virtual particles of the quantum vacuum act like a\nspecial 'Fizeau fluid'. Light scatters with the electrically charged and\naccelerated 'Fizeau fluid', resulting in curved paths.
