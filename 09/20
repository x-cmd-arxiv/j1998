This work develops and\nextends the work of Graham (1988), and places constraints on actual explosion\nmodels. The presence of the He I 10830 \\AA (2s^{3}S--2p^{3}P) line at $\\geq 10$\ndays post-explosion implies re-ionisation by $\\gamma$-rays from upwardly-mixed\nradioactive material produced during the explosion. Using the unmixed explosion\nmodel 10H (Woosley 1988) as well as mixed versions of it, we estimated the\n$\\gamma$-ray energy deposition by applying a purely absorptive radiative\ntransfer calculation. The deposition energy was used to find the ionisation\nbalance as a function of radius, and hence the 2s$^{3}$S population density\nprofile. This was then applied to a spectral synthesis model and the synthetic\nspectra were compared with the observations. Neither model 10H nor the mixed\nversion, 10HMM, succeeded in reproducing the observed He I 10830 \\AA line. The\ndiscrepancy with the data found for 10HMM is particularly significant, as this\nmodel has successfully reproduced the X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray observations and\nthe UVOIR light curve. We find that a match to the He I line profile is\nachieved by reducing the extent of mixing in 10HMM. Our reduced-mixing models\nalso reproduce the observed $\\gamma$-ray line light curves and the iron-group\nvelocities deduced from late-time infrared line profiles. We suggest that the\nHe I line method provides a more sensitive measure of the extent of mixing in a\ntype II supernova explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 1998 18:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
