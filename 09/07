The R-I and R-K colours of the faint optical counterparts are\nas expected for passively evolving elliptical galaxies, assuming that they\nfollow the R band Hubble diagram as determined for radio-bright GPS galaxies.\nWe have found evidence that the radio spectral properties of the GPS quasars\nare different from those of GPS galaxies: The observed distribution of radio\nspectral peak frequencies for GPS sources optically identified with bright\nstellar objects (presumably quasars) is shifted compared with GPS sources\nidentified with faint or extended optical objects (presumably galaxies), in the\nsense that a GPS quasar is likely to have a higher peak frequency than a GPS\ngalaxy. This means that the true peak frequency distribution is different for\nthe GPS galaxies and quasars, because the sample selection effects are\nindependent of optical identification. The correlation between peak frequency\nand redshift as has been suggested for bright sources has not been found in\nthis sample; no correlation exists between R magnitude (and therefore redshift)\nand peak frequency for the GPS galaxies. We therefore believe that the claimed\ncorrelation is actually caused by the dependence of the peak frequency on\noptical host, because the GPS galaxies are in general at lower redshifts than\nthe quasars. The difference in the peak frequency distributions of the GPS\ngalaxies and quasars is further evidence against the hypothesis that they form\na single class of object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 1998 17:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Previous claims\nof a disentangled vortex liquid for isotropic superconductors based on\nsimulations, are due to finite size effects. We explicitly show that the\neffective vortex-line tension vanishes precisely at the superconducting phase\ntransition in zero magnetic field. This loss of line tension is accompanied by\nan abrupt change in the connectivity of the vortex tangle across the\nsuperconductor. We also obtain results indicating that the connectivity of the\nvortex tangle changes in a similar way even in finite magnetic field, and\nsuggest that this could also be associated with a genuine phase-transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 1998 14:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 May 1999 17:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Report 494","categories":"math.OC math.PR","license":null,"abstract":"  The Geometrically Intrinsic Nonlinear Recursive Filter, or GI Filter, is\ndesigned to estimate an arbitrary continuous-time Markov diffusion process X\nsubject to nonlinear discrete-time observations. The GI Filter is fundamentally\ndifferent from the much-used Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and its second-order\nvariants, even in the simplest nonlinear case, in that: (i) It uses a quadratic\nfunction of a vector observation to update the state, instead of the linear\nfunction used by the EKF. (ii) It is based on deeper geometric principles,\nwhich make the GI Filter coordinate-invariant. This implies, for example, that\nif a linear system were subjected to a nonlinear transformation f of the\nstate-space and analyzed using the GI Filter, the resulting state estimates and\nconditional variances would be the push-forward under f of the Kalman Filter\nestimates for the untransformed system - a property which is not shared by the\nEKF or its second-order variants.\n  The noise covariance of X and the observation covariance themselves induce\ngeometries on state space and observation space, respectively, and associated\ncanonical connections. A sequel to this paper develops stochastic differential\ngeometry results - based on \"intrinsic location parameters\", a notion derived\nfrom the heat flow of harmonic mappings - from which we derive the\ncoordinate-free filter update formula. The present article presents the\nalgorithm with reference to a specific example - the problem of tracking and\nintercepting a target, using sensors based on a moving missile.

A diffusion X on a manifold N is run for a time interval T, with a\nrandom initial condition. There is a single observation consisting of a\nnonlinear function of X(T), corrupted by noise, and with values in another\nmanifold M. The noise covariance of X and the observation covariance themselves\ninduce geometries on M and N, respectively. Using these geometries we compute\napproximate but coordinate-free formulas for the \"best estimate\" of X(T), given\nthe observation, and its conditional variance. Calculations are based on use of\nJacobi fields and of \"intrinsic location parameters\", a notion derived from the\nheat flow of harmonic mappings. When any nonlinearity is present, the resulting\nformulas are not the same as those for the continuous-discrete Extended Kalman\nFilter.
