The calculations are based on exact diffraction theory\nthrough the vector equivalent of the Kirchoff integral. The present results are\nqualitatively similar to those of the non-retarded calculations. The light\nemission spectra have pronounced resonance peaks due to the formation of a\ntip-induced plasmon mode localized to the cavity between the tip and the\nsample. At a quantitative level, the effects of retardation are rather small as\nlong as the sample material is Au or Cu, and the tip consists of W or Ir.\nHowever, for Ag samples, in which the resistive losses are smaller, the\ninclusion of retardation effects in the calculation leads to larger changes:\nthe resonance energy decreases by 0.2-0.3 eV, and the resonance broadens. These\nchanges improve the agreement with experiment.
