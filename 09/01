We prove that every #P_{1}^{PH} function can be\ncomputed in FP^{#P_{1}^{#P_{1}}}. Consequently, every P set has an easy census\nfunction if and only if every set in the polynomial hierarchy does. We show\nthat the assumption of #P_1 being contained in FP implies P = BPP and that PH\nis contained in MOD_{k}P for each k \\geq 2, which provides further evidence\nthat not all sets in P have an easy census function. We also relate a set's\nproperty of having an easy census function to other well-studied properties of\nsets, such as rankability and scalability (the closure of the rankable sets\nunder P-isomorphisms). Finally, we prove that it is no more likely that the\ncensus function of any set in P can be approximated (more precisely, can be\nn^{\\alpha}-enumerated in time n^{\\beta} for fixed \\alpha and \\beta) than that\nit can be precisely computed in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 1998 12:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that, even if the deviations from the standard velocity\ndistribution that are compatible with our present knowledge of the solar\ninterior are small, they are sufficient to sensibly modify the sub-barrier\nnuclear reaction rates. The consequent changes of the neutrino fluxes are\ncomparable to the flux deficits that constitute the solar neutrino problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 1998 13:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
