This structure\nis studied here in three dimensions using both the new Optical Redshift Survey\n(ORS) and the IRAS 1.2 Jy redshift survey. The density contrast in a slab of\nthickness of 20 Mpc/h and diameter of 80 Mpc/h aligned with the standard de\nVaucouleurs' Supergalactic coordinates, is delta_sgp =0.5 for both ORS and\nIRAS. The structure of the SGP is not well described by a homogeneous\nellipsoid, although it does appear to be a flattened structure, which we\nquantify by calculating the moment of inertia tensor of the density field. The\ndirections of the principal axes vary with radius, but the minor axis remains\nwithin 30 deg of the standard SGP Z-axis, out to a radius of 80 Mpc/h, for both\nORS and \\iras. However, the structure changes shape with radius, varying\nbetween a flattened pancake and a dumbbell, the latter at a radius of ~50\nMpc/h, where the Great Attractor and Perseus-Pisces superclusters dominate the\ndistribution. This calls to question the connectivity of the `plane' beyond ~40\nMpc/h. The configuration found here can be viewed as part of a web of filaments\nand sheets, rather than as an isolated pancake-like structure. An optimal\nminimum variance reconstruction of the density field using Wiener filtering\nwhich corrects for both redshift distortion and shot noise, yields a similar\nmisalignment angle and behaviour of axes. The background-independent statistic\nof axes proposed here can be best used for testing cosmological models by\ncomparison with N-body simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 1998 10:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The basic\nGoldstone superfield associated with this breaking is shown to be the $(1,0)\nd=6$ hypermultiplet superfield $q^{ia}$ subjected to a non-linear\ngeneralization of the standard hypermultiplet superfield constraint. The\ndynamical equations implied by this constraint are identified as the manifestly\nworldvolume supersymmetric equations of the Type I super 5-brane in D=10. We\ngive arguments in favour of existence of an appropriate brane extension of\noff-shell hypermultiplet actions in harmonic superspace.

Consequently, $C(*)$ is an algebraic model for integral\nhomotopy types similar to Quillen's model of rational homotopy types. For\nfinite CW complexes, our model is finitely generated.

The\nsuspended mirrors are nonlinear oscillators interacting with each other through\nthe laser circulating in the cavity. The degrees of freedom decouple in normal\ncoordinates, which are the position of the center of mass and the length of the\ncavity. We introduce two parameters and study how the dynamics changes with\nrespect to these parameters. The first parameter specifies how strong the\nradiation pressure is. It determines whether the cavity is multistable or not.\nThe second parameter is the control parameter, which determines location of the\ncavity equilibrium states. The equilibrium state shows hysteresis if the\ncontrol parameter varies within a wide range. We analyze stability of the\nequilibrium states and identify the instability region. The instability is\nexplained in terms of the effective potential: the stable states correspond to\nlocal minima of the effective potential and unstable states correspond to local\nmaxima. The minima of the effective potential defines the resonant frequencies\nfor the oscillations of the cavity length. We find the frequencies, and analyze\nhow to tune them. Multistability of the cavity with a feedback control system\nis analyzed in terms of the servo potential. The results obtained in this paper\nare general and apply to all Fabry-Perot cavities with suspended mirrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 1998 17:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
