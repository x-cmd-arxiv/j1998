The extension has gauge invariance,\nenergy-momentum conservation, and covariance under observer rotations and\nboosts, while covariance under particle rotations and boosts is broken. The\nquantized theory is hermitian and power-counting renormalizable, and other\ndesirable features such as microcausality, positivity of the energy, and the\nusual anomaly cancellation are expected. Spontaneous symmetry breaking to the\nelectromagnetic U(1) is maintained, although the Higgs expectation is shifted\nby a small amount relative to its usual value and the $Z^0$ field acquires a\nsmall expectation. A general Lorentz-breaking extension of quantum\nelectrodynamics is extracted from the theory, and some experimental tests are\nconsidered. In particular, we study modifications to photon behavior.
