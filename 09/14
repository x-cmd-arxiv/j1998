This is\nbecause matter enhanced neutrino oscillations can lead to an anomalously hot\nnu_e spectrum, and thus to enhanced charged current cross sections in\nterrestrial detectors. Two recently proposed supernova neutrino observatories,\nOMNIS and LAND, will detect neutrons spalled from target nuclei by neutral and\ncharged current neutrino interactions. As this signal is not flavor specific,\nit is not immediately clear whether a convincing neutrino oscillation signal\ncan be extracted from such experiments. To address this issue we examine the\nresponses of a series of possible light and heavy mass targets, 9Be, 23Na,\n35Cl, and 208Pb. We find that strategies for detecting oscillations which use\nonly neutron count rates are problematic at best, even if cross sections are\ndetermined by ancillary experiments. Plausible uncertainties in supernova\nneutrino spectra tend to obscure rate enhancements due to oscillations.\nHowever, in the case of 208Pb, a signal emerges that is largely flavor specific\nand extraordinarily sensitive to the nu_e temperature, the emission of two\nneutrons. This signal and its flavor specificity are associated with the\nstrength and location of the first-forbidden responses for neutral and charge\ncurrent reactions, aspects of the 208Pb neutrino cross section that have not\nbeen discussed previously. Hadronic spin transfer experiments might be helpful\nin confirming some of the nuclear structure physics underlying our conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 1998 23:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-02"}

Such a dip occurs in low-density\nCDM models because structure forms early and dark matter halos of 10**12 solar\nmasses, containing galaxies with luminosities around L*, are unbiased tracers\nof the dark matter over this redshift range; their clustering amplitude then\nevolves similarly to that of the dark matter. At higher redshifts bright\ngalaxies become strongly biased and the clustering amplitude increases again.\nIn high density models, structure forms late and bias evolves more rapidly. As\na result, the clustering amplitude of L* galaxies remains constant from z=0 to\n1. The strength of these effects is sensitive to sample selection. The dip is\nweaker for galaxies with lower star formation rates, redder colours, higher\nluminosities and earlier morphological types.

In the phase\nsegregated regime, we find that there are two distinct phases: the weakly\nsegregated phase characterized by a `penetration depth' and the strongly\nsegregated phase characterized by a healing length. In the weakly segregated\nphase the symmetry of the shape of each condensate will not take that of the\ntrap because of the finite surface tension, but its total density profile still\ndoes. In the strongly segregated phase even the total density profile takes a\ndifferent symmetry from that of the trap because of the mutual exclusion of the\ncondensates. The lower critical condensate-atom number to observe the complete\nphase segregation is discussed. A comparison to recent experimental data\nsuggests that the weakly segregated phase has been observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 1998 13:19:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 1998 08:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Roughly put, this states that if two Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y\nare mirror partners, then X and Y have special Lagrangian torus fibrations\nwhich are dual to each other. Much work on this conjecture is necessarily of a\nspeculative nature, as in dimension 3 it is still a very difficult problem of\nhow to construct such fibrations. Nevertheless, assuming the existence of such\nfibrations there are many things one can prove. This paper covers a number of\nissues. First it applies results from the theory of completely integrable\nhamiltonian systems to understand some aspects of the geometry of such\nfibrations. From this, using reasonable regularity assumptions on the\nfibrations, one can understand how the cohomology of dual fibrations are\nrelated. We then study the question of how, given one such fibration, one would\nput a symplectic and complex structure on the dual fibrations, generalising\nwork of Hitchin. While this question cannot be answered at this stage, these\nresults should give insight into the nature of the problem. We sum up these\nideas in a refined version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture.\n  Finally, to give evidence for this conjecture, we prove it explicitly for K3\nsurfaces.

Relativistic y-scaling is\nconsidered by generalising the non relativistic scaling function to the\nrelativistic case, and it is shown that y-scaling does occur in the usual\nrelativistic scaling variable resulting from the energy conservation in the\ninstant form of dynamics. The present approach of y-scaling is fully covariant,\nwith the deuteron being described by eight components, viz. the 3S_1^{++},\n3S_1^{--}, 3D_1^{++}, 3D_1^{--}, 3P_1^{+-}, 3P_1^{-+}, 1P_1^{+-}, 1P_1^{-+}\nwaves.

It is found that the\nsqueeze-out signal is strongly affected by in-medium potentials of these\nmesons. The repulsive $K^+$-nucleus potential gives rise to a pronounced\nout-of-plane emission of $K^+$'s at midrapidity. With the $K^+$ potential we\nreproduce well the experimental data of the $K^+$ azimuthal distribution. It is\nfound that the attractive $K^-$-nucleus potential cancels to a large extent the\ninfluence of rescattering and reabsorption of the $K^-$ mesons on the\nprojectile and target residuals (i.e. shadowing). This results in an\nazimuthally isotropic emission of the midrapidity $K^-$ mesons with transverse\nmomentum up to 0.8 GeV/c. Since it is well accepted that the shadowing alone\nwould lead to a significant out-of-plane preference of particle emission, in\nparticular at high transverse momenta, the disappearance of the out-of-plane\npreference for the $K^-$ mesons can serve as an unambiguous signal of the\nattractive $K^-$ potential. We also apply a covariant formalism of the kaon\ndynamics to the squeeze-out phenomenon.
