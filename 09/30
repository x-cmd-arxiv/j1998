The situation is\nmore complex as far as the s elements are concerned. Their relation with the\nalpha elements is not linear.

We survey current world data for all three. Today,\nthe most precise value of $V_{ud}$ comes from the nuclear decays; however, the\nprecision is limited not by experimental error but by the estimated uncertainty\nin theoretical corrections. The neutron data are approximately a factor of four\npoorer in precision but this could change dramatically in the near future as\nplanned experiments come to fruition. The nuclear result (and the most recent\nof the neutron decay results) differ at the 98% confidence level from the\nunitarity condition for the CKM matrix. We examine the reliability of the small\ncalculated corrections that have been applied to the data, and assess the\nlikelihood of even higher quality nuclear data becoming available to confirm or\ndeny the discrepancy. Some of the required experiments depend upon the\navailability of intense radioactive beams. Others are possible today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 1998 20:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
