Monte Carlo\nsimulations are used to estimate the expected number of interloper field stars.\n  Astrometric members are listed for 12 young stellar groups, out to a distance\nof ~650 pc. These are the 3 subgroups Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus Lupus and\nLower Centaurus Crux of Sco OB2, as well as Vel OB2, Tr 10, Col 121, Per OB2,\nalpha Persei (Per OB3), Cas-Tau, Lac OB1, Cep OB2, and a new group designated\nas Cep OB6. The selection procedure corrects the list of previously known\nastrometric and photometric B- and A-type members, and identifies many new\nmembers, including a significant number of F stars, as well as evolved stars,\ne.g., the Wolf-Rayet stars gamma^2 Vel (Vel OB2) and EZ CMa (Col 121), and the\nclassical Cepheid delta Cep in Cep OB6. In the nearest associations the\nlater-type members include T Tauri objects and other pre-main sequence stars.\n  Astrometric evidence for moving groups in the fields of R CrA, CMa OB1, Mon\nOB1, Ori OB1, Cam OB1, Cep OB3, Cep OB4, Cyg OB4, Cyg OB7, and Sct OB2, is\ninconclusive, due to their large distance or unfavorable kinematics.\n  The mean distances of the well-established groups are systematically smaller\nthan previous estimates. The mean motions display a systematic pattern, which\nis discussed in relation to the Gould Belt. Six of the 12 detected moving\ngroups do not appear in the classical list of nearby OB associations. The\nnumber of unbound young stellar groups in the Solar neighbourhood may be\nsignificantly larger than thought previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 1998 14:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The narrow Gaussian potential is a means of regularising a\ndelta-function potential---it tends to the delta-function potential in the\nlimit of the width parameter going to zero. Exact predictions of viscometric\nfunctions in simple shear flow are obtained with the help of a retarded motion\nexpansion and by Brownian dynamics simulations. It is shown that for relatively\nsmall non-zero values of the width parameter, the presence of excluded volume\ncauses a swelling of the dumbbell at equilibrium, and shear thinning in simple\nshear flow. On the other hand, a delta function excluded volume potential does\nnot lead to either swelling or to shear thinning.

Polyakov and G.~ 'tHooft in 1974. Numerous and unsuccessful attempts of\nexperimental search for monopole in cosmic rays and on accelerators in high\nenergy particle collisions have been done. Also the searches have been carried\nout in mica for monopole tracks as well as for relict monopoles, entrapped by\nferromagnetic inclusions in iron-ores, moon rock and meteorites. These\nentrapped monopoles, when released, would have the lowest velocities\n$\\beta<10^{-6}$ and do not yield ionization at all, and are hard to detect.\nTherefore it is necessary to examine thoroughly the mechanisms of slow heavy\nmonopole interaction with matter and their scale of energy loss.\n  We discuss here the interaction of a massive slow magnetic monopole with\nmagnetically ordered matter, with conductors, superconductors and with\ncondensed matter in general. Our results indicate that the energy loss of a\nslow supermassive monopole reach $10^{8} eV/cm$ and more if we take into\nconsideration the Cherenkov radiation of magnons or phonons and conductivity of\nthe media. A new method of search for cosmic and relict monopoles by\nmagnetically ordered film is considered too. This approach resembles the\ntraditional method of nuclear emulsion chamber.

The fundamental\nPlanck mass is at a $\\tev$ and the observed weakness of gravity at long\ndistances is due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. In\nthis picture the standard model fields are localized to a $(3+1)$-dimensional\nwall or ``3-brane''. The hierarchy problem becomes isomorphic to the problem of\nthe largeness of the extra dimensions. This is in turn inextricably linked to\nthe cosmological constant problem, suggesting the possibility of a common\nsolution. The radii of the extra dimensions must be prevented from both\nexpanding to too great a size, and collapsing to the fundamental Planck length\n$\\tev^{-1}$. In this paper we propose a number of mechanisms addressing this\nquestion. We argue that a positive bulk cosmological constant $\\bar\\Lambda$ can\nstabilize the internal manifold against expansion, and that the value of\n$\\bar\\Lambda$ is not unstable to radiative corrections provided that the\nsupersymmetries of string theory are broken by dynamics on our 3-brane. We\nfurther argue that the extra dimensions can be stabilized against collapse in a\nphenomenologically successful way by either of two methods: 1) Large,\ntopologically conserved quantum numbers associated with higher-form bulk U(1)\ngauge fields, such as the naturally occurring Ramond-Ramond gauge fields, or\nthe winding number of bulk scalar fields. 2) The brane-lattice-crystallization\nof a large number of 3-branes in the bulk.

The ``transition''\nHamiltonian that has been associated with this procedure is however only an\napproximation, which ignores off-resonance effects and does not correctly\npredict the associated phase factors. In this paper, the exact effective\nHamiltonian for evolution of the spins' state in a rotating frame is derived,\nboth under irradiation of a single peak (on-transition) as well as between the\npeaks of the doublet (on-resonance). The accuracy of these effective\nHamiltonians is validated by comparing the observable product operator\ncomponents of the density matrix obtained by simulation to those obtained by\nfitting the corresponding experiments. It is further shown how both the\non-transition and on-resonance fields can be used to implement the\ncontrolled-NOT gate exactly up to conditional phases, and analytic expressions\nfor these phases are derived. In Appendices, the on-resonance Hamiltonian is\nanalytically diagonalized, and proofs are given that, in the weak-coupling\napproximation, off-resonance effects can be neglected whenever the\nradio-frequency field power is small compared to the difference in resonance\nfrequencies of the two spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 1998 16:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-23"}
