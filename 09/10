We analyze the variability properties of the light\ncurves, and find that two variable components, written B and R respectively,\nmust contribute to the blue-bump emission in this object. The B component\nproduces most of the variability in the ultraviolet domain. A maximum time\nscale of variability of about 2 yr identical at all wavelengths is found. If\ndiscrete events produce this component, the event rate is ~3-30 yr^-1. Assuming\nan isotropic emission, each event must liberate about 10^51 erg in the form of\noptical-to-ultraviolet radiation. The spectral properties of the B component\nsuggest that reprocessing on a truncated disk, or partially- thick\nbremsstrahlung may be the emission mechanism. We find evidence of a lag of a\nfew days between the light curves of the B component at optical and ultraviolet\nwavelengths. Neither the variability properties, nor the spectral properties of\nthe R component can be accurately measured. This component varies on very long\ntime scales, and may completely dominate the historical light curve of 3C 273\nin the optical domain. Combining knowledge from other wavelengths, we obtain\nseveral indications that this component could reveal the ``blazar'' 3C 273.

Recently\nthere has been increasing evidence that neutron stars possessing higher dipole\nspin-down fields do in fact exist, including a growing list of anomalous X-ray\npulsars (AXPs) with long periods and spinning down with high period\nderivatives, implying surface fields of $10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ Gauss.\nFurthermore, the recently reported X-ray period and period derivative for the\nSoft Gamma-ray Repeater (SGR) source SGR1806-20 suggest a surface field around\n$10^{15}$ Gauss. None of these high-field pulsars have yet been detected as\nradio pulsars.

First the temporal evolution\nof the event is similar to the observed in other solar and stellar flares, with\nan initial impulsive phase characterized by a strong increase in the\nchromospheric lines (the H_alpha EW change in a factor of 5 in only one day)\nand thereafter, the line emission decreased gradually over several days.\nSecond, a broad component in the H_alpha line profile is observed just at the\nbeginning of the event.

The main\naim is the measurement of iron abundances from UV spectra obtained with the\nHST-GHRS. In addition atmospheric parameters and abundances for He, C, N, O,\nand Si are derived from optical spectra (ESO CASPEC) for ROA 5701 or taken from\nliterature for Barnard 29. Both stars are found to be post-asymptotic giant\nbranch stars. Surprisingly, their iron abundances lie significantly below the\ncluster abundance in both cases. Barnard 29 lies 0.5 dex below the iron\nabundance derived for giant stars in M 13 and the iron abundance of ROA 5701 is\nthe lowest of any star in omega Cen analysed so far. Barnard 29 shows the same\nabundance pattern as the red giant stars in M 13, except for its stronger iron\ndeficiency. The iron depletion could be explained by gas-dust separation in the\nAGB progenitor's atmosphere, if iron condensed into dust grains which were then\nremoved from the atmosphere by a radiatively driven wind. The interpretation of\nthe abundance pattern for ROA 5701 is hampered by the star-to-star abundance\nvariations seen in omega Cen, but its abundance pattern appears to be\nconsistent with the gas-dust separation scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 1998 12:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

With probabilistic beliefs the agent will be able to\nquantify the likelihood of the various outcomes of its actions and is better\nable to utilize the information gathered from its error-prone actions and\nsensors.

By investigating the phase structure of the\nmodel at $T \\neq 0$ we get the following observations; i) Starting from the\nperturbative calculations with the theory renormalized at an arbitrary\nmass-scale $\\mu$ and at an arbitrary temperature $T_0$, we can in principle\nfully resum terms of $O(\\lambda T/\\mu)$ together with terms of $O(\\lambda\n(T/\\mu)^2)$.

With the lack of freedom we can set only one\nRS-fixing condition to absorb the large terms of $O(\\lambda T/\\mu)$, thus only\nthe partial resummation of these terms can be carried out. iii) In the above\ntwo analyses the temperature-dependent phase transition of the model is shown\nwith the analytic evaluation to proceed through the second order transition.\nThe critical exponents are estimated analytically and are compared with those\nin other analyses. iv) Our resummation method does not work if we start from\nthe theory renormalized at T=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 1998 08:14:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 1998 07:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Each identification\nsequence is always used just once and new sequences are ``refuelled'' from a\nshared provably secret key transferred through the quantum channel. Two\nidentification protocols are devised. The first protocol can be applied when\nlegitimate users have an unjammable public channel at their disposal. The\ndeception probability is derived for the case of a noisy quantum channel. The\nsecond protocol employs unconditionally secure authentication of information\nsent over the public channel, and thus it can be applied even in the case when\nan adversary is allowed to modify public communications. An experimental\nrealization of a quantum identification system is described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 1998 10:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In case of a\ngeneral rotationally invariant potential the angular momentum decomposition\nleads to a theory of Jost functions. The anyon statistics parameter gives rise\nto an interpolation for angular momenta analogous to the Regge trajectories for\ncomplex angular momenta.
