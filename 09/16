The\nmetallicities [Mg/H] predicted from these SNRs range from ~-4 to ~-1.5 and the\nmass of Mg in a SN is well correlated with its progenitor's mass. Thus the\nobserved [Mg/H] in an extremely metal deficient star has a correspondence to\nthe progenitor's mass. A larger [Mg/H] corresponds to a larger progenitor's\nmass.

In this paper, we explore the\nrole of such extra dimensions for cosmology, focusing on cosmological phase\ntransitions in field theory and the Hagedorn transition and radius\nstabilization in string theory. In each case, we find that significant\ndistinctions emerge from the usual case in which such large extra dimensions\nare absent. For example, for temperatures larger than the scale of the\ncompactification radii, we show that the critical temperature above which\nsymmetry restoration occurs is reduced relative to the usual four-dimensional\ncase, and consequently cosmological phase transitions in extra dimensions are\ndelayed. Furthermore, we argue that if phase transitions do occur at\ntemperatures larger than the compactification scale, then they cannot be of\nfirst-order type. Extending our analysis to string theories with large internal\ndimensions, we focus on the Hagedorn transition and the new features that arise\ndue to the presence of large internal dimensions.
