A Wind\nBlwon Bubble (WBB) scenario is emplyed, in which a fast, tenuous wind from a\nBlue Supergiant expands into a slow, dense wind, expelled during an earlier Red\nSupergiant phase. The bipolar shapre develops due to a pole-to-equator density\ncontrast in the slow wind (ie, the slow wind forms a slow torus). We use the\nWind Compressed Disk (WCD) model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli (1992) to determine\nthe shape of the slow torus. In the WCD scenario, the shape of the torus is\ndetermined by the rotation of the progenitor star. We then use a self-similar\nsemi-analytical method for wind blown bubble evolution to determine the shape\nof the resulting bipolar nebula.\n  We find that the union of the wind-compressed-disk and bipolar-wind-blown-\nbubble models allows us to recover the salient properties of SN1987A's\ncircumstellar nebula. In particular, the size, speed and density of SN1987A's\ninner ring are easily reproduced in our calculations.
