Numerical experiments reveal that even very weak\nnon-Hamiltonian perturbations can dramatically increase the rate at which an\nensemble of orbits penetrates obstructions like cantori or Arnold webs, thus\naccelerating the approach towards an invariant measure, i.e., a\nnear-microcanonical population of the accessible phase space region. An\ninvestigation of first passage times through cantori leads to three\nconclusions, namely: (i) that, at least for white noise, the detailed form of\nthe perturbation is unimportant, (ii) that the presence or absence of friction\nis largely irrelevant, and (iii) that, overall, the amplitude of the response\nto weak noise scales logarithmically in the amplitude of the noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 1998 16:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The redshift identifications are believed to be\nalmost complete for $z < 0.8$. Approximately half of the galaxies lie in five\nnarrow redshift features with local velocity dispersions of $ \\sim 300 km/s$.\nThese narrow redshift ``peaks'' are primarily populated both by\nabsorption--line galaxies and the most luminous galaxies in the sample,\nalthough the incidence of emission lines in the luminous galaxies increases\nwith redshift. The estimated dynamical masses of these redshift peaks, and the\nsky distribution of the galaxies within them, appear similar to groups or poor\nclusters of galaxies in the local universe at various stages of virialization.\nSome groups of galaxies therefore form at epochs $z > 1.5$, and the galaxies in\nsuch groups appear to be coeval and to show little sign of ongoing star\nformation. The galaxies outside the redshift peaks are also clustered, albeit\nmore weakly, are less luminous and more frequently exhibit strong emission\nlines. These ``isolated'' galaxies therefore appear, on average, to form stars\nat later epochs than the strongly clustered galaxies. The galaxy SEDs derived\nfrom our $UBVRIK$ photometry are also very closely correlated with the galaxy\nspectral types and luminosities. These results have strong implications for the\nanalysis of redshift surveys at intermediate redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 1998 16:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
