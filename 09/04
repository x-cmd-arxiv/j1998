We describe the design of this\nstudy and present the images which have been obtained for the first half of our\n33-source sample. We find that the hosts of all three classes of luminous AGN\nare massive elliptical galaxies, with scalelengths ~=10 kpc, and R-K colours\nconsistent with mature stellar populations. Most importantly this is the the\nfirst unambiguous evidence that, just like radio-loud quasars, essentially all\nradio-quiet quasars brighter than M_R = -24 reside in massive ellipticals. This\nresult removes the possibility that radio `loudness' is directly linked to host\ngalaxy morphology, but is however in excellent accord with the\nblack-hole/spheroid mass correlation recently highlighted by Magorrian et al.\n(1998). We apply the relations given by Magorrian et al. to infer the expected\nEddington luminosity of the putative black hole at the centre of each of the\nspheroidal host galaxies we have uncovered. Comparison with the actual nuclear\nR-band luminosities suggests that the black holes in most of these galaxies are\nradiating at a few percent of the Eddington luminosity; the brightest host\ngalaxies in our low-z sample are capable of hosting quasars with M_R = -28,\ncomparable to the most luminous quasars at z = 3. Finally we discuss our\nhost-derived black-hole masses in the context of the\nradio-luminosity:black-hole mass correlation recently uncovered for nearby\ngalaxies by Franceschini et al. (1998), and the resulting implications for the\nphysical origin of radio loudness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 1998 21:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\ncoincidence between the X-ray (0.1-10 keV) and radio spectral index suggest\nthat most of the emission associated with the extended component is due to the\ninverse Compton process in the radio lobes. The extended circumnuclear emission\ncan be understood as Compton scattering of the IR-optical radiation emitted by\nthe hidden quasar and surrounding dusty/molecular torus. This is the first\nobservational evidence supporting the existence of this effect, which also\nprobes the relativistic electron spectrum at energies much lower than those\ninvolved in the synchrotron radio emission. The observed X-ray flux can be\nmatched by assuming that the energy density of the relativistic particles\nexceed the equipartition value by about a factor of 10.

A flux of low-energy cosmic rays strong enough to produce the\nobserved spectrum of gamma-rays implies substantial gamma-ray emission at a few\nMeV through nuclear de-excitation. It is shown that the existing limits on\nexcess 3-7 MeV emission from the Galactic plane, in concert with the\nconstraints from pion-decay gamma-ray emission at higher energies, are in\nserious conflict with an inverse bremsstrahlung origin of the Galactic soft\ngamma-ray emission for any physically plausible low-energy cosmic ray spectrum.\nWhile in case of energetic heavy nuclei the limits are violated by about an\norder of magnitude, for a large population of low-energy protons the implied\ngamma-ray line flux and pion-decay continuum intensity are larger than the\nexisting limits by at least a factor of 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 1998 13:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
