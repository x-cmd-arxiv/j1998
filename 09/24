The linear and\ndeterministic relation g=b*d between the density fluctuation fields of galaxies\ng and mass d is replaced by the conditional distribution P(g|d) of these as\nrandom fields, smoothed at a given scale and at a given time. The mean biasing\nand its nonlinearity are characterized by the conditional mean <g|d>=b(d)*d and\nthe local scatter by the conditional variance s_b^2(d). This scatter arises\nfrom hidden effects on galaxy formation and from shot noise. For applications\ninvolving second-order local moments, the biasing is defined by three natural\nparameters: the slope b_h of the regression of g on d (replacing b), a\nnonlinearity parameter b_t, and a scatter parameter s_b. The ratio of variances\nb_v^2 and the correlation coefficient r mix these parameters. The nonlinearity\nand scatter lead to underestimates of order b_t^2/b_h^2 and s_b^2/b_h^2 in the\ndifferent estimators of beta, which may partly explain the range of estimates.\nLocal stochasticity affects the redshift-distortion analysis only by limiting\nthe useful range of scales. In this range, for linear stochastic biasing, the\nanalysis reduces to Kaiser's formula for b_h (not b_v) independent of the\nscatter. The distortion analysis is affected by nonlinearity but in a weak way.\nEstimates of the nontrivial features of the biasing scheme are made based on\nsimulations and toy models, and a new method for measuring them via\ndistribution functions is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 1998 16:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our principal result is that the mean stellar oxygen abundances for\nall of these galaxies correlate very well with their mean velocity dispersions.\nThis implies that the balance between energy input from type II supernovae and\nthe gravitational potential energy controls how far chemical evolution proceeds\nin bulges, ellipticals, and dwarf spheroidals. It appears that chemical\nevolution ceases once supernovae have injected sufficient energy that a\ngalactic wind develops.

Here a proof is presented that demonstrates that the\nintertwiner of a vertex of such a spin network is uniquely determined, up to\nnormalization, by the representations on the incident edges and the\nconstraints. Moreover, the constraints, which were formulated for four valent\nspin networks only, are extended to networks of arbitrary valence, and the\ngeneralized relativistic spin networks proposed by Yetter are shown to form the\nentire solution set (mod normalization) of the extended constraints. Finally,\nusing the extended constraints, the Barrett-Crane model is generalized to\narbitrary polyhedral complexes (instead of just simplicial complexes)\nrepresenting spacetime. It is explained how this model, like the Barret-Crane\nmodel can be derived from BF theory by restricting the sum over histories to\nones in which the left handed and right handed areas of any 2-surface are\nequal. It is known that the solutions of classical Euclidean GR form a branch\nof the stationary points of the BF action with respect to variations preserving\nthis condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 1998 19:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Ordinarily, one imposes the condition $H^\\dagger=H$ on the\nHamiltonian, where $\\dagger$ represents the mathematical operation of complex\nconjugation and matrix transposition. This conventional Hermiticity condition\nis sufficient to ensure that the Hamiltonian $H$ has a real spectrum. However,\nreplacing this mathematical condition by the weaker and more physical\nrequirement $H^\\ddag=H$, where $\\ddag$ represents combined parity reflection\nand time reversal ${\\cal PT}$, one obtains new classes of complex Hamiltonians\nwhose spectra are still real and positive. This generalization of Hermiticity\nis investigated using a complex deformation $H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\\epsilon$ of the\nharmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, where $\\epsilon$ is a real parameter. The\nsystem exhibits two phases: When $\\epsilon\\geq0$, the energy spectrum of $H$ is\nreal and positive as a consequence of ${\\cal PT}$ symmetry. However, when\n$-1<\\epsilon<0$, the spectrum contains an infinite number of complex\neigenvalues and a finite number of real, positive eigenvalues because ${\\cal\nPT}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken. The phase transition that occurs at\n$\\epsilon=0$ manifests itself in both the quantum-mechanical system and the\nunderlying classical system. Similar qualitative features are exhibited by\ncomplex deformations of other standard real Hamiltonians\n$H=p^2+x^{2N}(ix)^\\epsilon$ with $N$ integer and $\\epsilon>-N$; each of these\ncomplex Hamiltonians exhibits a phase transition at $\\epsilon=0$.
