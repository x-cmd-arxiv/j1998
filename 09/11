A non-linear Monte Carlo technique\nwas employed, which in effect solves the Boltzmann equation and is not\nrestricted to near-isotropic particle distribution functions. This technique\nmodels the injection of thermal and pickup ions, the acceleration of these\nions, and the determination of the shock structure under the influence of the\naccelerated ions. The essential effects of injection are treated in a mostly\nself-consistent manner, including effects from shock obliquity, cross-field\ndiffusion, and pitch-angle scattering. Using recent determinations of pickup\nion densities, we are able to match the absolute flux of hydrogen in the ACRs\nby assuming that pickup ion scattering mean free paths, at the termination\nshock, are much less than an AU and that modestly strong cross-field diffusion\noccurs. Simultaneously, we match the flux ratios He$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ or\nO$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ to within a factor $\\sim 5$. If the conditions of strong\nscattering apply, no pre-termination-shock injection phase is required and the\ninjection and acceleration of pickup ions at the termination shock is totally\nanalogous to the injection and acceleration of ions at highly oblique\ninterplanetary shocks recently observed by the Ulysses spacecraft. The fact\nthat ACR fluxes can be modeled with standard shock assumptions suggests that\nthe much-discussed \"injection problem\" for highly oblique shocks stems from\nincomplete (either mathematical or computer) modeling of these shocks rather\nthan from any actual difficulty shocks may have in injecting and accelerating\nthermal or quasi-thermal particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 1998 16:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

A framework allowing the top quark mass to be of the order of the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking scale, while the remaining light quarks have much\nsmaller masses, due to the seesaw mechanism, is presented. The violation of the\nGIM mechanism is shown to be small and the tree level FCNC are suppressed\nnaturally. In this model, there are many particles which could contribute to\nthe FCNC in the one-loop level. Parameters of the model are constrained by\nusing the experimental data on K^0-\\bar{K}^0 mixing and \\epsilon_K. The rare K\nmeson decays K_{L,S} -> \\pi^0 \\nu \\bar{\\nu} and K^+ -> \\pi^+ \\nu \\bar{\\nu} are\nalso investigated in the model. In these processes the scalar operators\n(\\bar{s}d)(\\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau}\\nu_{\\tau}), which are derived from box diagrams in\nthe model, play an important role due to an enhancement factor M_K/m_s in the\nmatrix element <\\pi|\\bar{s}d|K>. It is emphasized that the K_L decay process\nthrough the scalar operator is not the CP violating mode, so B(K_L -> \\pi^0 \\nu\n\\bar{\\nu}) remains non-zero even in the CP conserved limit. The pion energy\nspectra for these processes are predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 1998 07:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
