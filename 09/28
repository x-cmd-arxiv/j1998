In certain\nareas such as biotechnology, semi-conductor physics, optical communications,\nthe impact of basic research is direct while, in other disciplines, the path\nfrom discovery to applications is full of surprises. As a consequence, there\nare persistent uncertainties in the quantification of the exact economic\nreturns of public expenditure on basic research. Here, we suggest that these\nuncertainties have a fundamental origin to be found in the interplay between\nthe intrinsic ``fat tail'' power law nature of the distribution of economic\nreturns, characterized by a mathematically diverging variance, and the\nstochastic character of discovery rates. In the regime where the cumulative\neconomic wealth derived from research is expected to exhibit a long-term\npositive trend, we show that strong fluctuations blur out significantly the\nshort-time scales: a few major unpredictable innovations may provide a finite\nfraction of the total creation of wealth. In such a scenario, any attempt to\nassess the economic impact of research over a finite time horizon encompassing\nonly a small number of major discoveries is bound to be highly unreliable. New\ntools, developed in the theory of self-similar and complex systems to tackle\nsimilar extreme fluctuations in Nature can be adapted to measure the economic\nbenefits of research, which is intimately associated to this large variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 1998 18:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Statistical NLP methods determine\nthe likelihood of a word combination from its frequency in a training corpus.\nHowever, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are\ninfrequent and do not occur in any given corpus. In this work we propose a\nmethod for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word\ncombinations using available information on ``most similar'' words.\n  We describe probabilistic word association models based on distributional\nword similarity, and apply them to two tasks, language modeling and pseudo-word\ndisambiguation. In the language modeling task, a similarity-based model is used\nto improve probability estimates for unseen bigrams in a back-off language\nmodel.

The model describes\nrather well the experimental fusion cross section and mean angular momentum for\nreactions between nuclei near the \\beta-stability line. It is shown that these\nquantities are significantly enhanced by few-nucleon transfer with large\npositive Q-value. A shape independent parameterization of the heavy ion\npotential at distances smaller then the touching point is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 1998 12:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
