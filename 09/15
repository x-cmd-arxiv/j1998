It may well be related to other fundamental\nquestions, such as the mechanism which heats and virializes the intracluster\nmedium (ICM), and the frequency at which the ICM is shocked. There is now\ncompelling evidence both from the cluster soft excess (CSE) and the `hard-tail'\nemissions at energies above 10 keV, that many clusters are luminous sources of\ninverse-Compton (IC) emission. This is the first direct measurement of cluster\nCR: the technique is free from our uncertainties in the ICM magnetic field, and\nis not limited to the small subset of clusters which exhibit radio halos. The\nCSE emitting electrons fall within a crucial decade of energy where they have\nthe least spectral evolution, and where most of the CR pressure resides.\nHowever their survival times do not date them back to the relic CR population.\nBy using the CSE data of the Coma cluster, we demonstrate that the CR are\nenergetically as important as the thermal ICM: the two components are in\npressure equiparition. Thus, contrary to previous expectations, CR are a\ndominant component of the ICM, and their origin and effects should be explored.\nThe best-fit CR spectral index is in agreement with the Galactic value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 1998 16:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

These\nare used, coupled with measurements of the central velocity dispersion found in\nthe literature, to determine the H band Fundamental Plane (FP) relation of this\ncluster. The same procedure is applied to previously available photometric data\nin the B, V, r, I, and K bands, to perform a multi-wavelength study of the FP.\nBecause systematic uncertainties in the value of the FP parameters are\nintroduced both by the choice of the fitting algorithm, and by the presence of\nstatistical biases connected with the sample selection procedure, we emphasize\nthe importance of deriving the FP parameters in the six photometric bands using\nan identical fitting algorithm, and appropriate corrections to eliminate the\neffects of sample incompleteness. We find that the FP mu_e coefficient is\nstable with wavelength, while the sigma coefficient increases significantly\nwith increasing wavelength, in agreement with an earlier result presented by\nPahre & Djorgovski. The slope of the FP relation, although changing with\nwavelength, never approaches the virial theorem expectation. We also find that\nthe magnitude of the slope change can be entirely explained by the presence of\nthe well known relation between color and magnitude among early-type galaxies.\nWe conclude that the tilt of the Fundamental Plane is significant, and must be\ndue to some form of broken homology among early-type galaxies, while its\nwavelength dependence derives from whatever mechanism (currently the preferred\none is the existence of a mass-metal content sequence) produces the\ncolor-magnitude relation in those galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 1998 12:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

In this regime, solid friction is\ndue to the generation of vibrational radiations which are subsequently damped\nout. We study periodic commensurate and incommensurate asperities and various\ntypes of disordered surfaces.

This symmetry is naturally broken by the mean field\ncranking approximation when a tilted (non-principal) axis orientation of the\nnuclear spin becomes stable. The possible tunneling forth and back between the\ntwo symmetry-related minima in the double-humped potential-energy surface\nappears as a typical bifurcation of the rotational band. We describe this\nmany-body process in which all nucleons participate by diagonalizing the\nnuclear Hamiltonian within a selected set of tilted and non-tilted cranking\nquasiparticle states. This microscopic approach is able to restore the broken\nD2 symmetry and reproduce the quantum fluctuations between symmetry- related\nHFB states which emerge as splitting of the band energies and in parallel\nstaggering in intraband M1 transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 1998 09:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In a first part I report on developments of the theory.\nSpecifically I describe the recent completion of the derivation of the\nco-ordinate space asymptotic behaviour of the wave function for three charged\nparticles in the continuum. This knowledge is increasingly being made use of in\nattempts to `derive' three-Coulomb particle wave functions to be used in all of\nconfiguration space which are solutions of the Schroedinger equation, though\nnot everywhere but at least in one or preferably all of the asymptotic regions.\nTheir practical application in approximate calculations of ionisation and\nbreakup processes is pointed out. The asymptotic three-charged particle wave\nfunctions find further use in investigations of asymptotic and analytic\nproperties of matrix elements of the three-body Coulomb resolvent. An important\nexample is the nonperturbative derivation, valid for all energies, of the\nlarge-distance behaviour of the optical potential. In the second part I\ndescribe renewed attempts to establish the few-body approach as a valuable tool\nfor calculating (energetic) atomic collision processes. At the end I briefly\ntouch upon the recent successful above-breakup-threshold calculation of\nproton-deuteron elastic scattering for a realistic potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 1998 10:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}

The\nrelaxation of collective motion and the width of giant multipole resonances in\nhot nuclei show a saturated behaviour with temperature caused by the memory\neffect in the collision integral. The development of the bulk and surface\ninstabilities of the nuclear Fermi-liquid is sensitive to the dynamic effects\nsuch as the FSD and the relaxation processes.
