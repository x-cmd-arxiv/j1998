While it appears that [Be/H] versus [Fe/H] has a\nlogarithmic slope near 1, it is rather the Be-O trend that directly arises from\nthe physics of spallation production. Using new abundances for oxygen in halo\nstars based on UV OH lines, we find that the Be-O slope has a large uncertainty\ndue to systematic effects, rendering it difficult to distinguish from the data\nbetween the secondary slope of 2 and the primary slope of 1. The possible\ndifference between the Be-Fe and Be-O slopes is a consequence of the variation\nin O/Fe versus Fe: recent data suggests a negative slope rather than zero\n(i.e., Fe $\\propto$ O) as is often assumed. In addition to a phenomenological\nanalysis of Be and B evolution, we have also examined the predicted LiBeB, O,\nand Fe trends in Galactic chemical evolution models which include outflow.\nBased on our results, it is possible that a good fit to the LiBeB evolution\nrequires only traditional the Galactic cosmic ray spallation, and the (primary)\nneutrino-process contribution to B11.

I compare the HST ultraviolet spectra now available for\nseven such ``UV-bright'' LINERs. The spectra of NGC 404, NGC 4569, and NGC 5055\nshow clear absorption-line signatures of massive stars, indicating a stellar\norigin for the UV continuum. Similar features are probably present in NGC 6500.\nThe same stellar signatures may be present but undetectable in NGC 4594, due to\nthe low signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum, and in M81 and NGC 4579, due to\nsuperposed strong, broad emission lines. The compact central UV continuum\nsource that is observed in these galaxies is a nuclear star cluster rather than\na low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), at least in some cases. At\nleast four of the LINERs suffer from an ionizing photon deficit, in the sense\nthat the ionizing photon flux inferred from the observed far-UV continuum is\ninsufficient to drive the optical H I recombination lines. Examination of the\nnuclear X-ray flux of each galaxy shows a high X-ray/UV ratio in the four\n``UV-photon starved'' LINERs. In these four objects, a separate component,\nemitting predominantly in the extreme-UV, is the likely ionizing agent, and is\nperhaps unrelated to the observed nuclear UV emission. Future observations can\ndetermine whether the UV continuum in LINERs is always dominated by a starburst\nor, alternatively, that there are two types of UV-bright LINERs:\nstarburst-dominated and AGN-dominated. Interestingly, recent results show that\nstarbursts dominate the nuclear energetics in many Seyfert 2s as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 1998 15:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
