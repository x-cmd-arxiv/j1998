We use the Press-Schechter model for the abundance\nof halos, and assume that each halo has a similar population of clouds, with\ntotal mass and spatial distribution constrained to fit observations of the\ncolumn density distribution. We show that the kinematics of the multiple\nabsorbing components revealed in absorption profiles of the low-ionization\nlines, presented by Prochaska & Wolfe, are consistent with our spherical halo\nmodel.\n  The presence of multiple absorbing components with a large covering factor,\ncombined with the small impact parameters of the systems predicted in our\nanalytical model and in numerical simulations, implies a high rate of energy\ndissipation in cloud collisions. We calculate the rate of energy dissipation in\nour model, and show that it is far greater than the rate at which energy can be\nsupplied by gravitational mergers of halos. This poses a problem for the model\nof merging protogalactic clumps of Haehnelt et al., based on numerical\nsimulations. We also present new constraints on the amplitude of the power\nspectrum in hierarchical theories required to account for the observed velocity\ndispersion in the absorbers. We find that the linearly extrapolated rms\nfluctuation on spheres of radius HR = 100 km/s at z=4 must be greater than\n0.75. Although this limit is obtained only for our specific model of the\nabsorbing components, it should not be highly model-dependent because the\nvelocity dispersion of the absorbers is essentially determined by the velocity\ndispersion of the halos where the gas is moving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 1998 16:58:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
