The lobes are more\nconspicuous and the central source is fainter in 13CO than in 12CO.\n  The velocity field observed around the nucleus shows a very steep gradient\n(140 km/s over 75 pc), which is very probably caused by the stellar bar visible\nin the near infrared. The dynamical centre coincides with the IR peak and is\nshifted 6\" north-east of the compact 13CO source. The two CO lobes appear to be\nassociated with the ends of the bar and not with a molecular ring, as usually\nassumed. They are probably shaped by the strong UV radiation from the central\nregion. 13CO must be more photodissociated than the self-shielded 12CO\nmolecules in the central ~250 pc region, which may explain the relative\nweakness of the 13CO central source.\n  A 130 pc-wide bubble of molecular gas has been identified, which happens to\nhost the most luminous compact radio source in M82. It lies 120 pc west of the\nIR peak between the central source and the western lobe and seems characterized\nby warmer gas, strong UV radio free-free radiation, and an enhanced cosmic ray\nproduction rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 1998 13:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
