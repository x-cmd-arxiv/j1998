The consideration is done in terms of the usual\nrandom temperature Ginzburg-Landau Hamiltonian in space dimensions $D < 4$ in\nthe zero external magnetic field. It is shown that in the paramagnetic phase,\nat temperatures not too close to $T_{c}$ (where the behaviour of the pure\nsystem is correctly described by the Gaussian approximation), the free energy\nof the system has additional non-perturbative contribution of the form\n$\\exp{-(const) \\frac{\\tau^{(4-D)/2}}{u}}$ (where $\\tau = (T-T_{c})/T_{c}$),\nwhich has essential singularity in the parameter $u \\to 0$ which describes the\nstrength of the disorder. It is demonstrated that this contribution appears due\nto non-linear localized (instanton-like) solutions of the mean-field stationary\nequations which are characterized by the special type of the replica symmetry\nbreaking . It is argued that physically these replica instantons describe the\ncontribution from rare spatial \"ferromagnetic islands\" in which local (random)\ntemperature is below $T_{c}$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 1998 10:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Several possible formalisms are known, defined by different\ndefinitions of event and by different selection criteria for sets of histories.\nThese formalisms have a natural interpretation, according to which nature\nsomehow chooses one set of histories from among those allowed, and then\nrandomly chooses to realise one history from that set; other interpretations\nare possible, but their scientific implications are essentially the same.\n  The selection criteria proposed to date are reasonably natural, and certainly\nraise new questions. For example, the validity of ordering inferences which we\nnormally take for granted --- such as that a particle in one region is\nnecessarily in a larger region containing it --- depends on whether or not our\nhistory respects the criterion of ordered consistency, or merely consistency.\n  However, the known selection criteria, including consistency and medium\ndecoherence, are very weak. It is not possible to derive the predictions of\nclassical mechanics or Copenhagen quantum mechanics from the theories they\ndefine, even given observational data in an extended time interval. Attempts to\nrefine the consistent histories approach so as to solve this problem by finding\na definition of quasiclassicality have so far not succeeded.\n  On the other hand, it is shown that dynamical collapse models, of the type\noriginally proposed by Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber, can be re-interpreted as set\nselection criteria within a quantum histories framework, in which context they\nappear as candidate solutions to the set selection problem. This suggests a new\nroute to relativistic generalisation of these models, since covariant\ndefinitions of a quantum event are known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 1998 21:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
