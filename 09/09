The broadening of the\nscattered emission lines of the quasar can be used to measure the temperature\nof these electrons. For gas in virial equilibrium, the velocity width of the\nscattered line profile is larger by a factor of (m_p/m_e)^{1/2}=43 than the\nvelocity dispersion of the host galaxy and reaches >10,000 km/s for the massive\ngalaxies and groups in which bright quasars reside.

Based on these results, the cosmological\nevolution of the FRII population and hence that of the environments of these\nsources can be constrained. The environments are found to be denser and/or more\nextended at high redshifts. The bow shock surrounding the cocoon of FRII\nsources compresses and heats the IGM. A numerical integration of the\nhydrodynamic equations governing the gas flow between the bow shock and the\ncocoon boundary is presented.

It is robust and, for the examples we studied, the\ncomputational effort scales linearly with the number of equations. The\nalgorithm is based on a wavelength decomposition that combines conjugate\ngradient, multi-scaling and iterative splitting methods into a single approach.\nOn the surface, the algorithm is a simple preconditioned conjugate gradient\nwith all the sophistication of the algorithm in the choice of the\npreconditioning matrix. The preconditioner is a very good approximate inverse\nof the linear operator. It is constructed from the inverse of the coarse\ngrained linear operator and from smoothing operators that are based on an\noperator splitting on the fine grid. The coarse graining captures the long\nwavelength behavior of the inverse operator while the smoothing operator\ncaptures the short wavelength behavior. The conjugate gradient iteration\naccounts for the coupling between long and short wavelengths. The coarse\ngrained operator corresponds to a lowerresolution approximation to the PDEs.\nWhile the coarse grained inverse is not known explicitly, the algorithm only\nrequires that the preconditioner can be a applied to a vector. The coarse\ninverse applied to a vector can be obtained as the solution of another\npreconditioned conjugate gradient solver that applies the same algorithm to the\nsmaller problem. Thus, the method is naturally recursive. The recursion ends\nwhen the matrix is sufficiently small for a solution to be obtained efficiently\nwith a standard solver. We have tested our solver on the porous flow equation.\nOn a workstation we have solved problems on grids ranging in dimension from\n$10^3$ to $10^6$, and found that the linear scaling holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 1998 00:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
