Since IC 10 is at a very low Galactic latitude, its foreground\nextinction is expected to be high and the uncertainty associated with that\ncorrection is the largest contributor to the error associated with its distance\ndetermination.

This enabled a direct comparison of\nC18O integrated intensities and column densities with dust extinction over a\nrelatively large range of cloud depth (2 < Av < 30 mag) at 240 positions inside\nL977.

As soon as the detection\nof the possible GRB 970111 X-ray afterglow was reported by Feroci et al. (1998)\nwe reanalyzed the optical data collected for the GRB 970111 field. Although we\ndetect small magnitude variability in some objects, no convincing optical\ncounterpart is found inside the WFC error box. Any change in brightness 19\nhours after the GRB is less than 0.2 mag for objects with B < 21 and R < 20.8.\n  The bluest object found in the field is coincident with 1SAXJ1528.8+1937.\nSpectroscopic observations revealed that this object is a Seyfert-1 galaxy with\nredshift z=0.657, which we propose as the optical counterpart of the X-ray\nsource.\n  Further observations allowed to perform multicolour photometry for objects in\nthe GRB 970111 error box. The colour-colour diagrams do not show any object\nwith unusual colours. We applied a photometric classification method to the\nobjects inside the GRB error box, that can distinguish stars from galaxies and\nestimate redshifts. We were able to estimate photometric redshifts in the range\n0.2 < z < 1.4 for several galaxies in this field and we did not find any\nconspicuous unusual object.\n  We note that GRB 970111 and GRB 980329 could belong to the same class of\nGRBs, which may be related to nearby sources (z ~1) in which high intrinsic\nabsorption leads to faint optical afterglows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 1998 13:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The model\nallows to analyze tunnelling both from bulk-like contacts and from 2D\naccumulation layers. The fine features in the I-V characteristics due to the\nquantum dot states are known to be shifted to different voltages depending upon\nthe value of the magnetic field. While this effect is also well reproduced by\nour calculations, in this work we concentrate on the amplitude of each current\nresonance as a function of the magnetic field. Such amplitudes show\noscillations reflecting the variation of the density of states at the Fermi\nenergy in the emitter. Furthermore the amplitude increases as a function of the\nmagnetic field for certain features while it decreases for others. In\nparticular we demonstrate that the behaviour of the amplitude of the current\nresonances is linked to the value of the angular momentum of each dot level\nthrough which tunnelling occurs. We show that a selection rule on the angular\nmomentum must be satisfied. As a consequence, tunnelling through specific dot\nstates is strongly suppresses and sometimes prohibited altogether by the\npresence of the magnetic field. This will allow to extract from the\nexperimental curves detailed information on the nature of the quantum dot\nwavefunctions involved in the electronic transport.

This trend is both desirable and\ninevitable. Cyberspace will provide the basis for wonderful new ways to inform,\nentertain, and educate people. The information and the corresponding systems\nwill streamline commerce, but will also provide new levels of personal service,\nhealth care, and automation. The most significant benefit will be a\nbreakthrough in our ability to remotely communicate with one another using all\nour senses.\n  The ACM and the transistor were born in 1947. At that time the stored program\ncomputer was a revolutionary idea and the transistor was just a curiosity. Both\nideas evolved rapidly. By the mid 1960s integrated circuits appeared --\nallowing mass fabrication of transistors on silicon substrates. This allowed\nlow-cost mass-produced computers. These technologies enabled extraordinary\nincreases in processing speed and memory coupled with extraordinary price\ndeclines.\n  The only form of processing and memory more easily, cheaply, and rapidly\nfabricated is the human brain. Peter Cohrane (1996) estimates the brain to have\na processing power of around 1000 million-million operations per second, (one\nPetaops) and a memory of 10 Terabytes. If current trends continue, computers\ncould have these capabilities by 2047. Such computers could be 'on body'\npersonal assistants able to recall everything one reads, hears, and sees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 1998 19:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Those dispositions are correct, but that is not because of quantum\nnumbers nor angular momentum nor a \"Pauli exclusion principle\".\n  Matter waves were discovered in the early 20th century from their wavelength,\nwhich was predicted by DeBroglie to be, Planck's constant divided by the\nparticle's momentum. But, the failure to obtain a reasonable theory for the\nmatter wave frequency resulted in loss of interest. That problem is resolved in\n\"A Reconsideration of Matter Waves\" in which a reinterpretation of Einstein's\nderivation of relativistic kinetic energy [which produced his famous E = mc^2]\nleads to a valid matter wave frequency and a new understanding of particle\nkinetics and the atom's stable orbits.\n  It is analytically shown that the orbital electron arrangement is enforced by\nthe necessity of accommodating the space that each orbiting electron's matter\nwave occupies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 1998 00:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 1998 20:32:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2005 01:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 18 May 2005 22:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, in classical computing there is another class of unitary\ntransforms, the wavelet transforms, which are every bit as useful as the\nFourier transform. Wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi-scale\nstructure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing\nand quantum data compression. In this paper, we derive efficient, complete,\nquantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms, the quantum\nHaar and quantum Daubechies $D^{(4)}$ transforms. Our approach is to factor the\noperators for these transforms into direct sums, direct products and dot\nproducts of unitary matrices. In so doing, we find that permutation matrices, a\nparticular class of unitary matrices, play a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we\nfind that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are\nnot always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically, and vice\nversa. In particular, the computational cost of performing certain permutation\nmatrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly.\nHowever, quantum mechanically, these permutation operations must be performed\nexplicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the\nquantum transform. We consider the particular set of permutation matrices\narising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop efficient quantum circuits\nthat implement them. This allows us to design efficient, complete quantum\ncircuits for the quantum wavelet transform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 1998 22:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
